IMPORTANCE Autism behavioral therapy is effective but expensive and difficult to access.
While mobile technology-based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing
demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence-driven
wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial in which participants received
the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy
and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were
completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the
Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD
diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included.
Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was
enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018.
Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018.

INTERVENTIONS The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by
the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by
detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to
conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Four socialization measures were assessed using an
intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction.

RESULTS Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed
with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were
randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements
on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as
usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P = .005). Positive mean treatment
effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold
of P = .0125.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland
Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with
standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to
demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of

children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition,
suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement.
This study underscores the potential of digital home therapy to augment the standard of care.

Effect of Wearable Digital Intervention for Improving Socialization in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder

utism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence has increased

dramatically in the United States in the past few decades

to 1 in 59 children.! While the symptoms of ASD vary
widely, difficulty with socialization is a core deficit.? Children
struggle to engage in joint attention, sustain eye contact, and rec-
ognize facial expressions.?”° Experts recommend 20 hours per
week of applied behavioral analysis (ABA)”*° often incorporat-
ing naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions’ with
a behavioral therapist for at least 2 years.” Although these behav-
ioral interventions are effective, they are costly (between $40 000
and $60 000 per child per year®), and many children face chal-
lenges generalizing therapy to real-world contexts.” Furthermore,
the increase in prevalence of ASD has outpaced availability of be-
havioral therapists, creating wait-lists of up to 18 months in the
United States.° Learning aids based on novel ubiquitous technolo-
gies using machine learning can begin to address these problems
by creating opportunities for therapy that are accessible outside
of the clinician’s office. Such tools may generalize to the natu-
ral environment where the social skills are used and act as acare
bridge while children wait for standard therapy.

We designed a wearable social learning aid for children with
ASD to encourage facial engagement and provide feedback to the
child during social interactions athome. A computer vision sys-
tem runs on Google Glass that is wirelessly connected to a smart-
phone app to provide the intervention to the child wearing the
glasses. We confirmed the feasibility of fit and its augmented re-
ality form factor in an in-laboratory feasibility study’° and ina
field test of home usage by children with ASD."” These design
studies supported the hypothesis that children aged 4 to 17 years
can comfortably wear the glasses and process the video and au-
dio cues provided through the smart glasses unit. Furthermore,
the field test study suggested that three 20-minute play sessions
per week for 6 weeks could improve social behavior, with amean
improvement of7.4 points on the Social Responsiveness Scale,
Second edition (SRS-II) (P < .01). Finally, these studies generated
a consensus by the participating children on the name, Super-
power Glass (SG).

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that chil-
dren with ASD randomized to use SG at home for 6 weeks along
with their ongoing ABA therapy will achieve greater improve-
ments in socialization compared with children of the same age
range engaged in ABA therapy alone. Although studies have es-
tablished the feasibility of using digital technology platforms
to deliver therapy to children with ASD,!*"* with the exception
of speech-generating devices in the home,” there have been few
clinical tests of the efficacy of digital tools as an intervention
to improve core symptomatic deficits in children with ASD.'?""*
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial with
an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis designed to test the effi-
cacy of a wearable machine learning tool for intervention ona
core ASD deficit in the natural home environment.

Key Points

Question Cana wearable artificial intelligence intervention
designed for use in the home to reinforce facial engagement and
emotion recognition improve socialization in children with autism
spectrum disorder?

Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 71 children with autism
spectrum disorder, children treated at home with the wearable
intervention showed a significant improvement in socialization
over children only receiving standard of care behavioral therapy.

Meaning The mobile intervention, which teaches the recognition
and relevance of emotion in the child's natural setting, can
augment standard of care therapy to achieve higher socialization
in children with autism spectrum disorder.

intervention ora treatment as usual control group (both groups
received ABA therapy at home at least twice per week) for
6 weeks. A clinical coordinator assigned the participants to
their condition. Another clinical coordinator who was blinded
to the assignment of participants recorded all primary and sec-
ondary outcome measures (see below) at the start of condi-
tion (intake), end of 6-week condition (posttest 1), and after
6-week follow-up (posttest 2). The baseline measures Social
Communication Questionnaire and abbreviated IQ were col-
lected only at intake. We included a crossover option for the
control arm participants, where their posttest 1 appointment
served as the start of their treatment period. The study pro-
tocol is provided in Supplement 1, and more details are pro-
vided in eMethods 1 in Supplement 2.

Eligibility and Screening

Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017
and enrolled if they were within driving distance of Stanford
University, had a child with ASD between age 6 and 12 years
currently receiving ABA therapy at least twice per week at
home, scored greater than 15 on the Social Communication
Questionnaire,'© and consented to participate. Parents pro-
vided written informed consent at their intake appointment.
We did not use IQ for eligibility. The study was conducted in
accordance with Stanford University’s institutional review
board.

Intervention

The SG intervention is worn by the child with ASD at home.
The system tracks faces, classifies the emotions of the child’s
social partners,'°"?"'”"'° and provides 2 forms of cues to the child
in real time. First, a green indicator box illuminates the smart
glasses unit’s peripheral monitor when a face is detected within
the outward-facing camera’s field of view. Second, an emoti-
con appears in the display and a robotic voice audio cue is
played through the bone-conducting speaker of the glasses
when a face is classified as expressing 1 of 8 emotions by the
machine-learning model: happy, sad, angry, scared, sur-
prised, disgust, “meh,” and neutral (Figure 1). Families can opt
to disable audio feedback. The system operates at a frame rate
of approximately 15 to 20 frames per second, so facial expres-
sions are typically recognized within 100 milliseconds.'®

Face tracking

Emotion classification

The child wears smart glasses (A), which are wirelessly synced to an Android
smartphone application (B), which runs the machine learning classifiers for face
tracking and emotion detection, enables game choice, launches the games, and
records the videos for later parent review. The outward facing camera of the
glasses captures facial image data that are transmitted to the smartphone for
immediate classification. A green box appears in the peripheral monitor of the
glass units when a face is detected. In addition, an emoji corresponding to 1 of 8

We designed the mobile app to be the control center that
allows the child’s caregiver to manage the system. The app re-
ceives images, runs the emotion classifier, and saves video and
usage data. We provided 3 engagement activity modes: (1) cap-
ture the smile, during which the child is prompted by audio
to find an emotion in a family member’s face by, for example,
telling a joke to elicit the happy emotion; (2) guess the emo-
tion, during which the caregiver asks the child to guess the
emotions they are acting and controls the response manu-
ally; and (3) free play, an unstructured activity during which
the child receives emotional cues for all individuals interact-
ing with them. We automatically logged the activities chosen
and compiled the videos of each session for families to re-
view, upload, or delete.

Those in the SG group were asked to use each of the 3 en-
gagement activities at least once and to use the device at home
for 20 minutes 3 times per week with family members and once
per week with their ABA behavior interventionist (BI), fora total
of 4 times per week. Because we gave families the option to
delete videos for privacy reasons, we measured usage through
the number of days on which at least 1 video was created,
whether saved or deleted, during the intervention period. This
was an open-label trial; families and their BI were unblinded
to the treatment. The clinical coordinator remained blinded
for the entire study.

Primary Outcome Measures (Unordered)
The SRS-II”° total score is a 65-item survey completed by a

child’s caregiver to identify the presence and severity of so-

emotions appears in the monitor when an emotion is detected. Both can appear
at the same time, as demonstrated in C. The Superpower Glass intervention
primarily consists of these 2 components, with the first encouraging facial
awareness and the second teaching correct labeling of the emotion exhibited by
the child's social partner. The display allows colors and emoticons to be seen by
the child within their peripheral field of view and does not require direct gaze.
The form factor therefore rarely averts attention.

cial impairment in children across 5 social domains. Scores be-
low and above 60 were consistent with typical development
and ASD, respectively.

The Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales, Second edition
(VABS-II),”! socialization subscale is an assessment that mea-
sures communication, daily living, socialization, motor func-
tioning, and adaptive behavior skills. The VABS-II has been
clinically validated for use to track change over time??? and
is used as an outcome measure in several randomized clinical
trials for children with ASD.?*° A higher score indicates greater
adaptive functioning. We set the socialization subscale a priori
as a primary end point and considered the full scale as a sec-
ondary outcome measure.

The Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment,
Second edition (NEPSY-II),?°Affect Recognition Domain
measures facial affect recognition of 6 emotions (happy,
sad, angry, fear, disgust, and neutral) from a standardized
set of photographs of children’s faces over 4 tasks. Higher
scores indicate a higher ability to correctly compare facial
expressions.

The Emotion Guessing Game (EGG) was designed by our
team to evaluate a child’s ability to correctly label emotions
expressed by a live human actor. The child’s score is calcu-
lated as the number of correct guesses made on 40 facial ex-
pressions randomized to include 5 examples of the 8 emo-
tions. The assessment was done in person by the blinded
clinical coordinator. In addition, we included the complete
Child Behavior Checklist?’ and VABS-II** composite score as
secondary endpoints.

Intake Screening Measures

We used the Social Communication Questionnaire!®?° to screen
for ASD and determine eligibility for the present study. A score
greater than 15 is consistent with an ASD diagnosis. The ab-
breviated IQ?° measures a child’s standard IQ score based on
anonverbal fluid reasoning task and a verbal knowledge task.

Analysis Sets

We performed analysis on 4 sets of participants. The primary
ITT analysis was performed on what is henceforth referred to
as the ITT cohort, including all participants who were random-
ized into the study. We performed secondary analyses on the
completers cohort, which included treatment and control par-
ticipants who completed all intake and posttest 1 measures;
the treatment-first cohort, which included all participants as-
signed to treatment (ITT); and the full-treatment cohort, which
included all participants who received the intervention and
completed at least their first posttest appointment after the in-
tervention, including crossover participants (eMethods 2 in
Supplement 2).

Primary Analysis

To test the efficacy of SG plus ABA vs ABA alone, we used a
generalized linear mixed-effects regression model and as-
sessed each outcome separately. The model included all avail-
able measurements for all participants randomized in the study,
including withdrawn participants and those who did not ad-
here to the intervention. Specifically, for each outcome mea-
sure M in the measures section above, and individual iat time
of measure t, we applied the following model: M;, = Yo + Yor + Yi
weeks,, + Y2 treatment; + y; weeks,, x treatment, + €;,, where
the individual-specific random effect, yo; was included to ac-
count for correlation across repeated measurements within an
individual over time, weeks,, represents the number of weeks
elapsed since randomization for the ith individual at the tth
time point, and treatment, is an indicator representing whether
the ith individual belongs to the treatment-first group. To test
for significance, we use a 2-sided Wald test on y, (represent-
ing the impact of treatment over time) at the Bonferroni-
adjusted level of .0125 to account for the testing of our 4 pri-
mary outcomes. We excluded 3 participants from the ITT cohort
owing to arandomization error at the intake appointment; test-
ing was performed to ensure that their removal does not affect
significance in any of the primary analyses.

We further assessed whether abbreviated IQ, age, or sex were
modifiers of treatment in the regression analysis. For this pur-
pose, we augmented the above analysis to include the modifier
(eg, age) and interaction terms with treatment, week, as well as
a 3-way interaction term with treatment and week. Likelihood
ratio tests then assessed whether the modifier significantly im-
pacted the treatment effect. In addition to the primary ITT co-
hort, we applied the same mixed-effects model analysis to the
completers cohort to evaluate the impact of the intervention on
outcomes among those who completed the study.

Six-Week Follow-up Analysis
To test ifa return to baseline occurred in the treatment group,

we applied a model that tracks gains from intake to posttest 1

and posttest 2 only among those assigned to the treatment
group: Mj, = Yo + Yoi t+ Y; weeks,, x [posttest 1],, + y. week-
Sir x [posttest 2],, + €;,, where a Wald test on y2 allowed us to
test whether gains at 12 weeks were (still) significantly differ-
ent from the intake baseline. The sign and magnitude of the
coefficient indicates the point value of the change. We also per-
formed a follow-up analysis on the entire treatment cohort, in-
cluding control participants who crossed over (eMethods 2 in
Supplement 2).

Secondary Measures

We applied the ITT model from the primary analysis to the sec-
ondary measures, Child Behavior Checklist and the full VABS-II
scale. We also performed the same moderator analysis on the
secondary outcome measures.

Treatment Cohort Analysis

We performed further exploratory analyses on the treatment-
first cohort and then on the full treatment cohort, which in-
cluded the crossover group. Using mixed-effects linear regres-
sion methods, we compared changes in outcome measures to
baseline values of abbreviated IQ, age, usage, and the level of
BI involvement to evaluate additional trends, such as in-
creased effect of SG use on particular age groups and devel-
opmental levels.

Results

A total of 474 families were screened for eligibility. Seventy-
four were initially enrolled, but 3 were later excluded owing
to arandomization error that occurred early in the study (their
data do not affect significance in any of the primary analy-
ses). Of the 71 enrolled participants remaining, 40 (56.3%) were
randomly assigned to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were ran-
domly assigned to control. One participant reported an ad-
verse reaction to the glasses. Participants received between 15
to 20 hours of standard ABA per week. The consort flow dia-
gram of the study participants is in Figure 2. Participant de-
mographics are reported in Table 1.

The mean (SD) treatment time between intake and posttest
1 was 6.81 (1.85) weeks. Families in the treatment group used
the device on a mean (SD) of 12.12 (5.80) times through the
6-week treatment period, 51% of the requested dosage of 24
days. Participants played guess the emotion and capture the
smile in 39.8% and 23.8% of the sessions, respectively, sug-
gesting a potential preference for structured games over the
unstructured free play option, which was chosen 36.4% of
the time. Families ran a mean (SD) of 3.9 (3.38) sessions with
their ABA BI, 65% of the recommended dose. Families did not
report problems with the emotion classification, and our
empirical measurement of accuracy (eMethods 1 in Supple-
ment 2) was 72%.

ment 2. The VABS-II socialization subscale score significantly
increased between start and end of the intervention in treat-
ment-to-control comparisons (mean treatment impact: 4.58
points, P = .005, mean learning effect: -1.56 points in the ITT
cohort; mean treatment impact: 5.38 points, P < .001, mean
learning effect: -1.58 points in the completers cohort). Emo-
tion Guessing Game, NEPSY-II-Affect, and SRS-II showed larger
positive mean changes in treatment participants compared
with controls, but those improvements were not significant
(Table 2). Moderator analyses for abbreviated IQ, age, and sex
showed a moderation effect for sex for the EGG, with girls
showing greater improvement (likelihood ratio test P = .004;
eTable 2 in Supplement 2).

Six-Week Follow-up Analysis

Results from the follow-up analysis conducted on the treat-
ment-first group for all ITT participants (n = 40) and com-
pleters (n = 27) are presented in Table 3. We observed a re-
duced mean improvement from intake to follow-up on the

VABS-II socialization subscale and loss of significance. We ob-
served significant gains on EGG (mean [SD] treatment change
over 12 weeks, 5.647 [1.166]; P < .001) and SRS-II (mean [SD]
treatment change over 12 weeks, —2.832 [0.951]; P = .003), from
intake to posttest 2 but not intake to posttest 1, like in the pri-
mary analysis. We present results on the full-treatment co-
hort including crossovers in eTable 3 in Supplement 2.

Secondary Measures

No significant changes from intake to posttest 1 were ob-
served on secondary measures (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). The
VABS-II adaptive composite score showed a moderation ef-
fect for age, with younger participants showing slightly greater
improvement (likelihood ratio test P = .04, eTable 2 in Supple-
ment 2).

Discussion

An ITT analysis revealed that children with ASD receiving ABA
who were randomized into the SG intervention showed sig-

nificant improvements between intake and conclusion on the
VABS-II socialization subscale, a clinical measure sensitive to
changes in socialization.?””° These gains were similar to those
exhibited in other studies.?*-?° Significant differences be-
tween cohorts were not observed on the other primary end
points. While there was a positive change on VABS-II social-
ization between intake and 6 weeks after the conclusion of the
SG treatment, this was not significant. Additional gains at
posttest 2 were observed for SRS-II and EGG, but given a lack
of posttest 2 control data, we cannot rule out a practice effect

for these measures. Overall, these results support the hypoth-
esis that the SG intervention can improve social skills of chil-
dren with ASD between the ages of 6 and 12 years as an aug-
mentation to standard of care therapy.

On average, participants used the device on half as many
days as initially recommended. Potential reasons for this in-
clude decreased motivation by parents to use the device over
time and/or decreased engagement from children with the de-
vice over time. These factors should be examined in future
studies by improving system engagement and further exam-
ining the impact of the intervention.

The SG intervention has at least 2 potential mechanisms
of action: reinforcement that faces have variation in emotion
(salience of emotion) and training on how to differentiate emo-
tions. Analyses of potential correlations between outcome mea-
sures and usage or participant demographics yielded no clear
conclusions about best responders. Nevertheless, we hypoth-
esize that the dual mechanisms of action may have contrib-
uted to the observed socialization gains despite use in fewer
sessions than the prescribed usage. Beyond these 2, it is pos-
sible that the learning aid generally encourages social inter-
action in the family around face contact and emotion, thereby
increasing social acuity in the child.

Limitations
While our change was in line with previous reports using the
VABS-II, the poststudy empirical variance suggested that the

Original Investigation Research

study may be underpowered by a factor of 2. Further limita-
tions include low participant adherence to the recommended
treatment dosing and the restricted recruitment of individu-
als to within driving distance of Stanford where the popula-
tion may be enriched for familiarity with technology. Addi-
tionally, owing to the inherent demographic and behavioral
heterogeneity of children with ASD and differing amounts of
ABA therapy received prior to the intervention, children be-
gan the intervention with varying levels of social skills. Fi-
nally, because control participants did not have a second
posttest appointment before crossing over into treatment, we
were unable to perform direct comparison tests for sustained
gains. While data from the treatment group points toward a
need to increase the 6-week treatment period, further re-
search is required.

Conclusions

This is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate effi-
cacy of a wearable behavioral intervention for children with
ASD, to our knowledge. The intervention teaches children emo-
tion recognition, facial engagement, and the salience of
emotion, suggesting the potential for multiple mechanism(s)
of action driving the observed improvement in social behav-
ior. Results of this study underscore the potential of digital
home therapy to augment the current standard of care.
