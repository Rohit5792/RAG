Introduction

Abnormal haemodynamic adaptation during the tran-
sitional circulation together with the impact of respira-
tory. distress. syndrome and related. factors. on. blood flow.
distribution [1] cause abnormalities in cerebral haemo-
dynamics. and oxygen supply. [2-4]. Near-infrared. spec-
troscopy (NIRS)-derived regional tissue oxygen satura-
tion of haemoglobin (rSt02). is. an. absolute. value. corre-
sponding to mixed blood saturation, and can be used. as.a
surrogate. measure for. venous oxygen saturation. [5]. This.
allows the derivation of several variables related to tissue
oxygen dynamics, such as oxygen delivery and consump-
tion and the ratio. between oxygen. delivery to. oxygen. ex-
traction, the so-called cerebral fractional oxygen extrac-
tion (FOE). [5, 6].. Theoretically, therefore, this. monitor-
ing system could help to adjust interventions with effects
on blood. and oxygen supply. to. the brain..

The SafeBoosC phase II randomised clinical trial hy-
pothesises that the burden of hypo- and hyperoxia can be
reduced,.and consequently the risk of brain injury, by. the
combined use of close monitoring of the cerebral rSto,
and an evidence-based. treatment guideline to. correct de-
viations in rStO, outside a predefined target range [7-9].
Accordingly, a. treatment guideline.has.been developed .fo-
cusing on interventions that could have.an impact on arte-
rial oxygen. saturation. (SaO), haemoglobin. concentra-
tion, and. cerebral blood. flow. (CBF), which are. the main
determinants of oxygen delivery to the brain. The purpose
of this report is to. describe the rationale for this treatment
guideline and the treatment recommendations.

Interventions That Affect Oxygen Delivery to the
Brain.

In. drawing up the treatment guideline we used. the
premise that hypoxia and hyperoxia are risk factors for an
adverse outcome in the preterm infant and should be
avoided. [10-15]. In addition to. NIRS assessment of the
cerebral. circulation, a number. of other. techniques,. par-

ticularly echocardiography, are used to assess the neona-
tal transitional circulation and related outcomes [1, 16-
27]. For the purposes of the treatment guideline, a sys-
tematic. review. of the literature was. carried. out. focusing.
on clinical studies conducted on human neonates that
used NIRS-derived variables as outcome measures sup-
porting the. statements listed in the treatment guideline
for intervention in the SafeBoosC phase II randomised
clinical trial. The literature. review. was. conducted in
March 2011 using the database PubMed and subject
headings. (MeSH terms). There. were no date restrictions..
The search board was kept to combine the concept of a
neonate (or newborn) with the concepts of NIRS and
cerebrovascular circulation. In addition, blood pressure,
hypotension, dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, anae-
mia,. blood transfusion, carbon dioxide, respiratory. dis-
tress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and
treatment, and. blood glucose. were. also. combined. with
the terms NIRS and newborn. This search was supple-
mented. by. cross. references.. Two. hundred. and. twenty-.
nine.abstracts were selected for review; among them, only
27% were relevant for the issues to be addressed in the
treatment guideline. Only 4% of the selected studies were
randomised clinical trials.

The. proposed treatment guideline for. the SafeBoosC
phase II randomised clinical trial is based on interven-
tions. that. may. optimise. cerebral oxygen. supply and.con-
sumption. through factors. such as perfusion pressure,
ventricular output, arterial oxygen content, arterial car-
bon dioxide, or blood glucose concentration. We assume
a rather steady cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Given
that the SafeBoosC intervention period focuses on the
first 3 days after an extremely low gestational age neonate
is born [8, 9],.disease states. and related factors. most.com-
monly present during that period were of particular inter-
est.. The. definition. of normal range for. cerebral. rStO,, in.
this trial (55-85%). was derived from Lemmers and van
Bel [unpubl. data] as the 95% CI of rSto, monitoring of
439 preterm infants. born at <32 weeks. during the first 3
days after birth using INVOS and the Adult SomaSensor
(Somanetics-Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). The application

found in these. infants. Device eligibility will be tested by
comparison of absolute values, reproducibility, and sen-
sitivity. to changes in oxygenation on the adult arm [28].
Absolute values and dynamic range within 5 percentage
points. of INVOS and reproducibility. better than 6% are
the predefined thresholds. So far, eligible devices for the

SomaSensor, NIRO 200NX (Hamamatsu Photonics, Fu-
kuoka, Japan). with a small probe holder, and OxyPrem,

trial (M.W.)..

We. developed. a pathophysiologically. oriented, evi-
dence-based treatment guideline and assessed the level of
recommendation according to the US Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) System from 2001 [29] (Appen-
dix). A new version of the USPSTF system is currently in
use [30] where the wording of the grade C recommenda-
tion is possibly. the. most important. change. with. respect
to. the previous version; it reads: “... against routinely pro-
viding X service for Y population; there may be consider-
ations. that. support providing the service in an individual
patient’. One of the actions listed in the present treatment
guideline (i.e. volume.expansion with normal saline). has
been classified as a grade C recommendation. This, as
well as the remaining actions included, is a suggested. but
not. mandated intervention, and all of them should be
considered individually.according to. the. patient’s overall
clinical condition. Newer. developments. for. grading the
quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations
[31].are more rigorous, but also. more complex and time
consuming. We, therefore, adhered to the USPSTF sys-
tem. due to its relative ease of use.

If rStO, falls out of the normal range (55-85%) and
there is. no.reason.to. believe that it will normalise. without
an. intervention, this treatment guideline aims to bring a
standardised approach to correct the deviation. As the ef-
fect. of certain interventions, such as the effect of cardio-
vascular drugs on blood pressure, are not expected to be
immediate, it is recommended to. choose. only one inter-
vention at a time and reassess after 30-60 min. It must be
kept in mind that many. routine. care-giving procedures
in the neonatal intensive care unit, such as. handling or
change.in posture. [32,33], endotracheal tube.reposition-
ing or suctioning [32], or blood sampling from umbilical
lines [34-36], among others, may have an impact on ce-
rebral haemodynamics and oxygenation. However, since
NIRS changes determined by these factors are usually
transient and can be anticipated, they have not been listed
in this. treatment guideline.

oxygen content. Accordingly, the assessment of cardio-
vascular. status, haemoglobin concentration, and Sa0,
should be done before an intervention is chosen.

Assessment/Interventions. Related to Cardiovascular

Status

Changes in rStO2 or FOE may follow changes in cere-
bral perfusion pressure in infants with haemodynamic in-
stability, which may. [37-39]. or may. not [40-42]. be. re-
flected by concordant changes in mean arterial blood
pressure.. Thus, this treatment guideline. would suggest to.
check the. cardiovascular. system, primarily. considering
clinical variables available in routine clinical practice,
such as blood pressure, blood lactate concentration, cap-
illary refill time, or urine output to define whether com-
promised systemic circulation is present or not. Echocar-
diography-derived variables on blood flow distribution,
such as cardiac output and superior vena cava flow mea-
surements, may. be. of value as. complementary. assess-
ments. to. indicate. or. guide intervention.

Administration of fluid bolus, vasopressor-inotropes
(dopamine or epinephrine), or inotropes (dobutamine),
has. a variable. effect. on blood pressure,. cardiac. perfor-
mance, and cerebral perfusion-oxygenation [16-20, 43].
The effect. of volume expansion on rStO, has not been
systematically explored in infants. However, a recent ran-
domised clinical trial has shown that delayed.cord clamp-
ing increases cerebral rStO, at 4 and 24 h after birth in
preterm infants [44]. This early increase in preload pos-
sibly. ameliorates cardiovascular maladaptation during
transitional circulation [45].

Studies in neonates have shown that dopamine [38,
43] and epinephrine [43], given to treat early systemic
hypotension,. increase. cerebral. perfusion-oxygenation..
The. 2-year. follow-up. of the study. population. showed
comparable. outcomes. in. vasopressor-inotrope-treated.
infants and infants who did not develop hypotension and
thus did not receive cardiovascular support early after
birth [16]. However, cautious use of vasopressors is. rec-
ommended, as increased afterload may further compro-
mise myocardial contractility causing additional decrease
in cardiac output [1], and consequently, worsening cere-
bral perfusion.

The. effect of a haemodynamically. significant PDA or
its treatment on cerebral haemodynamics and oxygen-
ation is addressed in a number of studies. using NIRS and.
other monitoring methods [46-61]. PDA may be a deter-
minant in blood flow. redistribution. causing decreased.
blood pressure and rSto2 and increased FOE [57]. How-
ever, no. correlation. was. found. between. ductal. size. and.

rStO [60]. Treatment of PDA may also be relevant for the
rStO, [57]. Indomethacin has been shown to have an
acute greater impact on cerebral perfusion and oxygen-
ation [47,. 49, 52, 58, 59]. than. ibuprofen. [51,. 52]. How-
ever, slower infusion rates did not have such an impact
on brain haemodynamics [61]. Surgical closure of the
PDA showed no consistent effects on cerebral circulation
and oxygenation [53-56].

Finally, mechanical factors, particularly lung overinfla-
tion, may decrease preload and cause increased pulmo-
nary. vascular. resistance. Both factors. would impair. myo-
cardial function and cardiac output [22-25]. This. condi-
tion should always be ruled out in case of decreasing rStO.

Assessment/Interventions Related to Oxygen

Transport (Blood Oxygen. Carrying Capacity).

Although there is no clear correlation between haemo-
globin concentration and tissue oxygen extraction [62,
63],. packed-red. cell transfusion improves cerebral oxy-
genation. in the anaemic preterm infant. [63-65]. In addi-
tion, a randomised clinical trial has shown that placental-
to-foetal transfusion increases rStO, [44], possibly not
only due to increased oxygen carrying capacity but also to
improved preload. A positive effect of this procedure on
superior vena cava flow has been recently reported [45].

Assessment/Interventions Related. to. Respiratory.

Status

Infants with respiratory distress syndrome have a sig-
nificantly larger. range of cerebral rSto, and FOE and a
stronger relation between these cerebral haemodynamic
variables. and. mean arterial blood pressure than infants
without respiratory distress syndrome [66]. One of the
most. important determinants. of CBF and cerebral oxy-
gen dynamics is partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO)
[46, 63, 67-70]. It is. crucial, because. inadvertent. hyper-
ventilation may occur as a result of mechanical ventila-
tion during the acute phase of respiratory distress syn-
drome. If PCO, is. below the normal range or low, even in
the normal range, we recommend considering to decrease
minute ventilation in case of low rStO, [63,.67-69]. Since
the effect of manipulating minute ventilation on rSto, has
not been tested. in a randomised trial, the. evidence level
in this guideline is only II. The understanding of the me-
chanics and physiology, as well as the epidemiological
link between hyperventilation and. brain injury and.cere-
bral palsy, however, may be seen as sufficient for a stron-
ger recommendation (A).

The effect of the type.of mechanical ventilation or air-
way. pressure. on. the. cerebral haemodynamics. and. oxy-

genation by NIRS has been the focus of some small obser-
vational studies. in newborns. [71-75]. The way these. dif-
ferent methods affect intrathoracic pressures would
likely. impact the cerebral and systemic. circulation of im-
mature neonates [76].

This treatment guideline has been modified after a pi-
lot trial [77] to specifically. warn against exceeding the up-
per threshold of Sa0, according to local policies. There-
fore, the fractional inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2).should
only be increased if SaO, is below the normal range or low,
even in. the normal range. [10].. Other. potential. actions.
relate. to. increasing SaO, through improvement in lung
recruitment by moderate increase in mean airway pres-
sure [22, 26, 75]..

rStO, increasing above the upper normal limit may re-
flectimpaired oxygen utilisation or disturbed cerebral au-
toregulation, and interventions should be directed at de-
creasing hyperaemia. The assessment of respiratory. sta-
tus and blood glucose content should. be done before an
intervention is. chosen.

Assessment/Interventions Related to Respiratory

Status

The first step would be decrease FiO, in case Sa is
above. the. normal range or high, even in the. normal
range [11-15]. Additional interventions would be to de-
crease. mean. airway. pressure. [26, 75]. The. vasodilator.
effect of PCO, should be considered, so. minute. ventila-
tion should be increased in case of PCO, above the nor-
mal range or. high, even in the normal range, to. lower
PCO, [63, 67-69].

Assessment of Blood Glucose Level

Hypoglycaemia. would. be the. cause. of capillary. re-
cruitment and increased CBF [27, 78]. Thus, if the blood
glucose. level is below the normal range or.low, even in the.
normal range, increased glucose intake should be consid-
ered to raise blood glucose concentration.

Conclusion.

This. treatment guideline. for. the SafeBoosC phase IL
trial aims. to help neonatologists to. take decisions in rela-
tion to cerebral oximetry readings. None of the suggested
actions. are mandatory. The. proposed clinical interven-
tion algorithm is focused on the main determinants of
cerebral perfusion-oxygenation changes. during the first
hours. after. birth in the extremely. low gestational age
neonate. population, and. is. thus. pathophysiologically.

oriented. The evidence supporting some of these state-
ments is. generally. rather weak. The proposed interven-
tions, however, are all routinely used in clinical care of
these. patients.. Particular. care. has. been. taken. on hyper-
ventilation with low PCO, and oxygen. administration
with high Sao, due to their association with adverse out-
comes.. We stress that this. guideline. is not approved for.
general use outside randomised clinical trials. We look
forward. to. be able. to report the results. of the present
SafeBoosC phase II randomised clinical trial and the
planned. SafeBoosC. phase. III randomised. clinical trial
that will evaluate the combined effect of NIRS. and this
treatment guideline [8, 9].
