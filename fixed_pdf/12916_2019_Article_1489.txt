Abstract

Background: Undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common cause of HIV-related mortality. Xpert MTB/
RIF (Xpert) is being rolled out globally to improve TB diagnostic capacity. However, previous Xpert impact trials
have reported that health system weaknesses blunted impact of this improved diagnostic tool. During phased
Xpert rollout in Botswana, we evaluated the impact of a package of interventions comprising (1) additional support
for intensified TB case finding (ICF), (2) active tracing for patients missing clinic appointments to support retention,
and (3) Xpert replacing sputum-smear microscopy, on early (6-month) antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality.
Methods: At 22 clinics, ART enrollees > 12 years old were eligible for inclusion in three phases: a retrospective standard
of care (SOQ), prospective enhanced care (EC), and prospective EC plus Xpert (EC+X) phase. EC and EC+X phases were
implemented as a stepped-wedge trial. Participants in the EC phase received SOC plus components 1 (strengthened

ICF) and 2 (active tracing) of the intervention package, and participants in the EC+X phase received SOC plus all three
intervention package components. Primary and secondary objectives were to compare all-cause 6-month ART
mortality between SOC and EC+X and between EC and EC+X phases, respectively. We used adjusted analyses,
appropriate for study design, to control for baseline differences in individual-level factors and intra-facility correlation.

Results: We enrolled 14,963 eligible patients: 8980 in SOC, 1768 in EC, and 4215 in EC-+X phases. Median age of ART
enrollees was 35 and 64% were female. Median CD4 cell count was lower in SOC than subsequent phases (184/ L in SOC,
246/ Lin EC, and 241/ L in EC+X). By 6 months of ART, 461 (5.3%) of SOC, 54 (3.2%) of EC, and 121 (3.0%) of EC+X enrollees
had died. Compared with SOC, 6-month mortality was lower in the EC+X phase (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence
interval, 0.61-0.97, p = 0.029). Compared with EC enrollees, 6-month mortality was similar among EC+X enrollees.

Conclusions: Interventions to strengthen ICF and retention were associated with lower early ART mortality. This new
evidence highlights the need to strengthen ICF and retention in many similar settings. Similar to other trials, no additional
mortality benefit of replacing sputum-smear microscopy with Xpert was observed.

Background

In resource-limited settings, tuberculosis (TB) remains
the most common cause of death among people living
with HIV (PLHIV), including those starting antiretroviral
therapy (ART), and is commonly undiagnosed at the
time of death [1, 2]. Death from undiagnosed TB or TB
diagnosed late is a key reason early (6-month) ART mor-
tality rates remain significantly higher in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) than resource-rich settings [2-4]. All data
point towards a critical need to improve TB case finding
among PLHIV starting ART.

In 2011, following World Health Organization (WHO)
endorsement of Xpert MTB/RIF® (Xpert) as the first-line
TB diagnostic test for symptomatic PLHIV [5], the
Botswana Ministry of Health (MOH) and partners initi-
ated planning for a phased national Xpert rollout [6].
Review of available program data for new HIV care
enrollees showed that many components of the intensi-
fied TB case finding (ICF) cascade, especially compliance
with the WHO-recommended 4-symptom TB screening
rule, and early retention in HIV care, should be
strengthened in order for Xpert to have maximum bene-
fit [7]. Weaknesses in the health system that have re-
sulted in poor completion of the TB diagnostic and
treatment cascade and sub-optimal retention in HIV
care, have been cited as important reasons for lack of
observed Xpert impact on PLHIV mortality in similar
settings [8, 9]. Therefore, Botswana used the Xpert roll-
out as an opportunity to strengthen ICF and retention in
early HIV care through rollout of a package of services
[6]. The intervention package has three components: (1)
additional support for ICF, (2) intensified tracing for pa-
tients missing clinic appointments to return them to
care, and (3) Xpert replacing sputum-smear microscopy.

No trial has yet evaluated impact of Xpert combined
with strengthened health systems on mortality [8-10]. We
evaluated impact of the Xpert, ICF, and retention package
versus standard of care on early ART patient mortality.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a multi-center, stepped-wedge cluster
randomized trial (CRT) with a retrospective baseline
component called the Xpert Package Rollout Evaluation
using a Stepped-wedge design (XPRES) trial. A stepped-

wedge rather than parallel group design was chosen be-
cause the Xpert, ICF, and retention package was ex-
pected to be beneficial for patients and the trial was part
of a national rollout [6].

Participants

A cluster was defined as an HIV care and treatment
clinic. Twenty-two clusters, located at five district hospi-
tals and 17 primary healthcare facilities, were purpos-
ively selected to (1) be representative of HIV treatment
clinics in Botswana and (2) have new ART initiation
rates sufficient to meet sample size requirements (see
Additional file 1, providing text on clinic selection cri-
teria). At these 22 clusters, individual patients were eli-
gible for study enrollment if they were new HIV clinic
attendees, regardless of TB treatment status, and not
prisoners at the time of the first HIV clinic visit. The
study aimed to enroll or offer enrollment to all eligible
HIV clinic attendees in three consecutive phases: (1) a
retrospective standard of care (SOC) phase, (2) a pro-
spective enhanced care (EC) phase, and (3) a prospective
EC plus Xpert (EC+X) phase (Fig. 1). For this pre-
defined protocol analysis, only those study enrollees who
newly started ART at or after study enrollment and were

12 years old at ART initiation were included [6].

Randomization and masking

The selected 22 clusters received TB diagnostic services
from 13 laboratories (Fig. 1). Because some of the study
clinics used the same TB diagnostic laboratory, full
Xpert, ICF, and retention package activation was
planned to be simultaneous for these clinic consortiums
(Fig. 1). After obtaining ethical approvals and agreement
to participate in the study from MOH at a central level
and MOH management at the selected facilities, the
study statistician randomly selected one of the rollout
permutations [6].

Procedures

At the 22 clusters, per Botswana national guidelines dur-
ing the time period of the study (July 2010 through June
2015), all study participants in all phases were eligible for
ART initiation if they had a CD4 count < 350 cells/ L,
were diagnosed as having WHO stage III/IV, or were
pregnant or breastfeeding [11]. All study participants

received clinical care and follow-up appointments accord-
ing to MOH guidelines (see Additional file 2, a table sum-
marizing standard clinical care follow-up).

Standard of care phase

Enrollment in the retrospective SOC phase was through
chart abstraction of eligible adult patients who started
ART between July 2010 and the end of July 2012 (Fig. 1)
[6]. The SOC phase enrollees received HIV care accord-
ing to national guidelines, limited ICF, infrequent active
tracing due to resource limitations, and sputum-smear
microscopy for presumptive TB patients.

Intervention phases EC and EC X

Prospective EC enrollment started in August 2012 and
was complete by January 2013. Prospective EC+X enroll-
ment occurred from October 2012 through March 2014
according to the stepped-wedge design (Fig. 1). EC phase
participants received SOC supplemented by two compo-
nents of the Xpert, ICF, and retention package (i.e., add-
itional support for ICF and intensified tracing) combined
with sputum-smear microscopy. EC+X phase partici-
pants received SOC supplemented by all three compo-
nents of the Xpert, ICF, and retention package (ie.,
additional support for ICF, intensified tracing, and Xpert
in place of sputum-smear microscopy). All interventions
were activated at the cluster-level for the benefit of all
clients receiving care at the clinic. EC and EC+X

participants were followed for 12 months, or until the
end of TB treatment, whichever was later. The final
follow-up visits for EC+X enrollees were in June 2015.

Interventions

The ICF and active tracing interventions were strength-
ened through four key mechanisms: (1) additional human
resources (study nurses) to support implementation, (2)
additional training for clinic and laboratory personnel, (3)
use of checklists and job aids to standardize implementa-
tion, and (4) regular supervisory visits to track adherence
to ICF and tracing checklists.

ICF intervention

Implementation of the WHO 4-symptom TB screening
rule (i.e., screening for cough of any duration, fever, loss
of weight, and night sweats) [12] was recommended for
all enrollees at each clinic visit in the SOC, EC, and
EC+X phases, but implementation was strengthened in
the EC and EC+X phases. In all phases, clients were con-
sidered symptomatic if they screened positive for one or
more of the four TB symptoms. In all phases, at least
two same-day, on-the-spot (spot) sputum samples were
recommended for collection from symptomatic clients.
As part of strengthened ICF in the EC and EC+X phases,
a previously published job-aid was used by study nurses
to inform the patient how to collect quality sputum sam-
ples [6]. Prior to the EC phase, laboratory personnel at
— — PAGE 4 — —

the 13 laboratories serving the 22 clusters received re-
fresher training on Ziehl-Neelsen staining for sputum-
smear microscopy, and prior to the EC+X phase, labora-
tory personnel were trained for Xpert implementation.
In all phases, sputum test results were returned to the
clinics, with clinicians responsible for informing the pa-
tients. In the SOC phase, the patient was informed of a
TB diagnosis at the next scheduled clinic appointment.
In the EC and EC+X phases, study nurses were trained
to work with laboratories to ensure the turnaround time
from sample collection to result return to the clinic was
<4days for sputum-smear microscopy and <2 days for
Xpert testing. In the EC and EC+X phases, nurses were
trained to inform patients of positive TB diagnoses the
same day via phone, or if unreachable by phone, by ac-
tive tracing to the household. Indicators monitoring im-
plementation of the ICF cascade were collected and used
to inform supervision visits (see Additional file 3, a table
summarizing the indicators) [7].

Active tracing intervention

Per national guidelines, clients 1day late for an HIV
clinic appointment should be traced through phone and
home visit starting the day after the missed visit. How-
ever, program reports showed this tracing was infre-
quently implemented in the SOC phase due to lack of
human and financial resources. Implementation of the
active tracing policy was strengthened in the EC and
EC+X cohorts. In the EC and EC+X phases, a patient lo-
cator form was used to document telephone numbers
and home addresses for intensified tracing activities to
support retention. Up to five telephone calls and two
home visits, facilitated by checklists, were used in at-
tempts to return clients, who had missed clinic appoint-
ments, to care. The key HIV care retention indicator
used for monitoring purposes was the rate of loss to
follow-up (LTFU) per 100 person-years (see Additional
file 3, a table summarizing the indicators). LTFU was de-
fined as being >60days late for a scheduled appoint-
ment, per Botswana guidelines.

Objectives and outcomes
The study had two primary objectives. The primary ob-
jective reported here is the non-randomized comparison
of all-cause 6-month ART mortality among adult ART
enrollees ( 12 years old) between the SOC and EC+X
phases [6]. The second primary objective, which aimed to
compare diagnostic sensitivity of the new Xpert-based TB
diagnostic algorithm with that of the sputum-smear-
microcopy-based algorithm, will be reported separately ac-
cording to diagnostic accuracy study reporting guidelines.
Secondary objectives reported in this paper include (1)
the comparison of 12-month ART mortality between SOC
and EC+X phases and (2), within the randomized

Page 4 of 14

stepped-wedge trial, the comparison of all-cause, adult, 6-
month ART mortality between the EC and EC+X phases.

We implemented intensive efforts to ascertain true
mortality outcomes among participants. Deaths and date
of death were either passively reported to the clinic by
friends or relatives of the deceased participant, or ac-
tively ascertained if the client had missed an appoint-
ment or was considered LTFU [13]. Initial efforts to
ascertain outcomes of clients who missed an appoint-
ment or were LTFU included phone outreach to the cli-
ent or contact and home visits. For participants in the
SOC phase, these efforts started after data entry was
complete which was always > 12 months after ART initi-
ation. In the EC and EC+X phases, this outreach started
immediately after the missed appointment, in an attempt
to return the client to care. For all clients unreachable
by phone or home visit who met the LTFU definition,
vital status was ascertained through national Death
Registry review. By law, since 1969, all deaths need to be
registered in the Death Registry, which is maintained by
the Civil and National Registration Office.

Sample size

As described previously [6], to obtain conservative sam-
ple size estimates, we used the approach of Moulton
et al., suitable for stepped-wedge trial designs, to esti-
mate required sample sizes to meet the primary study
objective comparing 6-month ART mortality rates be-
tween SOC and EC+X phases [14]. Funding limitations
restricted the number of clinics that could be included
in the study to 22. A between-cluster coefficient of vari-
ation of 0.2 was used based on review of the literature of
similar stepped-wedge trials [14]. Monthly HIV clinic
(cluster) size was derived from reported program ART
enrollment rates in the SOC phase and varied between
clinics (average, 23 ART enrollees/month; range, 8—46/
month). Prior to study start, available data from
Botswana suggested that all-cause, adult, 6-month ART
mortality rates were about 15 deaths per 100 person-
years [3, 15]. To provide > 80 power to detect a 40
reduction in all-cause 6-month ART mortality between
the two groups, assuming SOC mortality was 10/100
person-years, a 24-month SOC phase enrollment period
(| =12,144) and an 18 month EC+X phase enrollment
period ( = 6348) were chosen.

Statistical analysis

For the primary outcome analysis, time at risk for ART
enrollees started on the day of ART initiation and ended
at 6months of follow-up after ART initiation, or at the
time of death, LTFU, or transfer out if these events were
before 6 months of ART follow-up. Crude and multivari-
able Cox proportional hazards regression models, with a
random effect for clinic, were used to assess the effect of

intervention status (SOC vs EC+X) on time to death [6].
Per a pre-specified analysis plan, age at ART initiation,
sex, pregnancy status, and baseline CD4 count were a
priori covariates to be included in the multivariable
model. Hemoglobin at ART initiation [16], ART regimen
[17], and weight at ART initiation [16] were included in
the multivariable model because of their importance as
predictors of mortality in this and other analyses.

Pre-specified secondary analyses were conducted to
(1) compare 12-month ART mortality between SOC
and EC+X phases and (2) compare 6-month ART
mortality rates between cohorts EC and EC+X [6].
For the latter, we used analytic methods described by
Moulton et al., fitting Cox proportional hazards
models to the data with the underlying time frame
being time since August 2012 (initiation month for
the stepped-wedge component of the trial), fixed ef-
fect for intervention arm (Xpert device activation),
and a random effect for clinic [14]. The proportional-
ity assumption was checked using visual methods and
the Grambsch and Therneau test.

Per the pre-specified analysis plan, plausible interac-
tions between the intervention effect and other covari-
ates, including CD4 count at ART initiation, were
examined by comparing models with and without inter-
actions using the likelihood ratio test. Per the pre-
specified analysis plan, the primary time-to-event ana-
lytic approaches comparing SOC versus EC+X and EC
versus EC+X mortality rates assigned follow-up time to
the phase in which the participant started ART because
the interventions were expected to have maximum im-
pact around the time of ART initiation. However, two
pre-specified sensitivity analyses of this approach were
planned. The first sensitivity analysis censors follow-up
time for ART enrollees at the time of cross-over be-
tween phases, while the second assigns follow-up time
to contemporary intervention phases when cross-over
occurs, through use of a time-dependent covariate [18].
In addition, per a third pre-specified sensitivity analysis,
an inverse probability weighting approach was used to
account for non-enrollment in the EC and EC+X phases
of the study. Separate adjusted logistic regression models
for hospital versus clinic enrollees were used to predict
the probability of being enrolled in the study. Patients
consenting to enrollment were up-weighted by the in-
verse of the calculated enrollment probability. An ad-
justed logistic regression approach was used to estimate
inverse probability weights to lower the likelihood of
bias given the possibility of non-random enrollment in
the EC and EC+X phases [19]. All analyses were con-
ducted using STATA 14 or 16 (StataCorp, 2009, Stata
Statistical Software, Release 14 and 16, College Station,
TX). XPRES is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (trial
registration no. NCT02538952).

Results

Enrollment

Across the 22 study clinics, there were 528 months of
enrollment in the SOC phase (mean 24/clinic), 120
months in the EC phase (mean 5.5/clinic), and 299
months of enrollment in the EC+X phase (mean 13.6
months/clinic) (Fig. 2). All 10,047 eligible patients for
the SOC phase were enrolled. Among the 2703 and
5834 patients eligible for the EC and EC+X phases, re-
spectively, 1794 (66 ) and 4247 (73 ) consented to en-
rollment. The main reason eligible clients were not
enrolled prospectively is that they left the clinic before
they could be offered enrollment. The demographic and
clinical characteristics of clients consenting to enroll-
ment were very similar to the characteristics of clients
not enrolled (see Additional file 4, a table comparing
characteristics of those enrolled versus not enrolled).
We excluded from this analysis patients who transferred
into the clinic on ART (1 = 1067), were < 12 years old at
ART initiation (1=22), or did not start ART during
follow-up (1 = 36) (Fig. 2). In total, 8980, 1768, and 4215
patients were included in the SOC, EC, and EC+X
phases for analysis, respectively.

Baseline characteristics

Among all study enrollees included in the analysis, me-
dian age was 35 (interquartile range (IQR) 29-42) at
ART initiation and the percentage female was 64 and
these characteristics were similar between phases
(Table 1). Among female enrollees, the percentage who
were pregnant at the time of ART initiation was lower
in the SOC phase (16 ) than EC (23 ) and EC+X (32 )
phases. Among all enrollees, median weight (58.4 kg)
and median hemoglobin (11.7 g/dL) were similar be-
tween phases. However, median CD4 count at ART ini-
tiation was lower in the SOC phase (184 cells/ L) than
in the EC (246 cells/ L) and EC+X (241 cells/ L) phases.
In addition, the percentage of enrollees with mild or
moderate anemia per WHO criteria was higher in the
SOC phase (56 ) than EC (48 ) and EC+X phases
(46 ). Tenofovir (combined with lamivudine or emtrici-
tabine and efavirenz or nevirapine) was less commonly
prescribed as first-line ART in the SOC (78 ) compared
with the EC (93 ) and EC+X (96_ ) phases.

Primary outcome: 6-month ART mortality in SOC versus
EC X

By 6 months after ART initiation, 461 (5.3 ) of enrollees
in the SOC phase had died compared with 121 (3.0 ) of
enrollees in the EC+X phase. Six-month ART mortality
rates were 11.4 deaths per 100 person-years in the SOC
phase versus 6.3 deaths per 100 person-years in the
EC+X phase (Table 2). Compared with the SOC phase,
6-month mortality was lower in the EC+X phase in

unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, 95 CI
0.48-0.71, p< 0.001) (Fig. 3, Table 2). After controlling
for potential confounders, including age, sex, pregnancy
status, weight, CD4 count, hemoglobin, and ART regi-
men, 6-month mortality remained lower in the EC+X
phase compared with the SOC phase (adjusted HR, 0.77,
95 CI 0.61-0.97, p = 0.029).

Intervention effect size was similar across CD4 strata
(see Additional file 5, a figure showing cumulative mor-
tality incidence stratified by CD4 count at ART initi-
ation). In addition, effect size was robust to sensitivity
analyses that censored follow-up time at the time of
transition between phases or assigned follow-up time to
contemporary intervention phases using a_ time-
dependent covariate (see Additional file 6, a table show-
ing these sensitivity analyses). Effect size was robust to
sensitivity analysis using an inverse probability weighting
approach to account for non-enrollment in EC and
EC+X phases (see Additional file 7, a table showing
these sensitivity analyses).

Secondary outcomes: 12-month ART mortality in SOC
versus EC X

By 12months after ART initiation, 551 (6.5 ) of SOC
versus 137 (3.7 ) of EC+X phase enrollees had died.
Twelve-month mortality rates were 7.3/100 person-years
in the SOC versus 4.6/100 person-years in the EC+X

phase. Compared with the SOC phase, 12-month mor-
tality was lower in the EC+X phase in both unadjusted
(HR 0.58, 95 CI 0.48-0.70, p<0.001) and adjusted
(AHR 0.76, 95 CI 0.61-0.95, p=0.014) analyses
(Table 2). Intervention effect size was robust to sensi-
tivity analyses (see Additional files 6 and 7, tables
showing sensitivity analyses).

Secondary outcomes: 6-month ART mortality in EC versus
EC X

By 6months of ART follow-up among ART enrollees
in the EC phase, 54 (3.2 ) of enrollees had died. Six-
month mortality rates were similar between the EC
(6.5/100 person-years) and EC+X phases (6.3/100
person-years) in both unadjusted and adjusted pre-
specified analyses (AHR 1.13, 95 CI, 0.63—2.03),
where all follow-up time was assigned to the phase in
which the patient started ART (Table 2). In sensitivity
analyses comparing EC vs. EC+X 6-month mortality
rates, the AHR was 0.90 (95 CI 0.42-1.95) when EC
enrollee follow-up time was censored at the time of
EC+X cross-cover, and 0.79 (95 CI 0.41-1.50) when
EC enrollee follow-up time in the EC+X phase was
assigned to the EC+X phase using a time-dependent
variable (see Additional file 6, a table showing sensi-
tivity analyses).

Among SOC, EC, and EC+X phase enrollees respect-
ively, 359 (4 ), 44 (2 ), and 122 (3 ) were diagnosed
with TB and had started TB treatment prior to arrival at
the HIV treatment clinic. Therefore, in the SOC, EC,
and EC+X phases, 8621, 1724, and 4093 patients were
eligible for TB symptom screening before ART initiation.

for at least one TB symptom if they had lower weight
and lower CD4 count at ART initiation (see Add-
itional file 8, a table showing predictors of being
screened for TB in the SOC cohort).

Among SOC, EC, and EC+X enrollees eligible for
screening, 525 (6 ), 514 (30 ), and 1249 (31 ) screened
positive for at least one TB symptom and 199 (2_ ), 237
(14 ), and 688 (17 ) provided a sputum sample for TB
diagnosis (Fig. 4). Ultimately, 129 (1 ), 86 (5 ), and 244
(6 ) enrollees in the SOC, EC, and EC+X phases were
newly diagnosed with TB and started TB treatment be-
fore ART initiation or during the first 6 months of ART.
The number of pulmonary TB diagnoses in the SOC
(n= 123), EC (n=68), and EC+X (m=198) phases that
were confirmed microbiologically was 22 (18 ), 35
(51 ), and 129 (65 ), respectively (Table 3).

Early ART LTFU

By 6 months after ART initiation, cumulative LTFU inci-
dence, uncorrected by subsequent mortality ascertain-
ment efforts, in the SOC, EC, and EC+X phases, was 4 ,
1 , and 1 , respectively (see Additional file 9, a table
summarizing these cumulative LTFU incidence percent-
ages). Compared with 6-month LTFU rates in the SOC
phase (8.3/100 person-years), rates of 6-month LTFU
were lower in the EC (1.2/100 person-years) and EC+X
(1.6/100 person-years) phases in both unadjusted and

adjusted analyses (see Additional file 10, a table compar-
ing LIFU rates between SOC, EC, and EC+X phases).

Discussion

In Botswana, compared with SOC, interventions to
strengthen WHO-recommended TB symptom screening
and ICF algorithms combined with active tracing to sup-
port retention were associated with increased TB case
finding and lower early ART mortality. No additional
mortality benefit of replacing sputum-smear microscopy
with Xpert was observed.

Although implementation of the WHO-recommended
4-symptom TB screening rule as the first step in ICF al-
gorithms among PLHIV starting ART has been recom-
mended since 2011 along with TB-HIV care continuum
retention interventions including active tracing [20], no
study has yet reported on the potential impact on mor-
tality of strengthening systems to implement these
guidelines [7]. Although the observed reduction in all-
cause mortality between SOC and subsequent EC and
EC+X phases represents a pre- versus post-comparison,
rather than a randomized comparison, and is therefore
at risk of residual confounding, the study has a number
of strengths that suggest ICF and retention interventions
did independently contribute to observed mortality
impact. Firstly, the reduction in all-cause mortality
remained statistically significant after adjusting for key

*To meet other study objectives related to estimation of diagnostic accuracy of the smear microscopy-based and Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithms, one spot

covariates. Secondly, the improvements in TB screening,
TB case finding, and uncorrected LTFU rates between
SOC and subsequent EC and EC+X phases were large,
providing credence that these interventions were a driver
behind observed mortality reductions. Thirdly, very high
ascertainment of the primary early ART mortality out-
come improves ability to interpret observed mortality
changes. Fourthly, the intervention effect size and statis-
tical significance were robust to several sensitivity ana-
lyses. Therefore, these findings represent important
additional evidence in support of current WHO ICF and
retention guidelines, and support continued or add-
itional investment from donors to strengthen health sys-
tems to implement these guidelines for all HIV clinic
enrollees [9].

Although it was widely anticipated that introduction of
the new more sensitive TB diagnostic test (Xpert) in
place of sputum-smear microscopy would independently
reduce mortality among PLHIV, this study and six of the
seven previously reported Xpert impact trials have not
observed any independent impact of Xpert versus
sputum-smear microscopy on mortality [8, 21]. In the
one trial that did observe Xpert impact on mortality, the
mortality benefit was restricted to clients with advanced
HIV disease (WHO stage III/IV) [21]. Furthermore, pro-
gram data have clearly shown that leaks in the ICF cas-
cade before a TB diagnostic test is implemented,
especially failure to implement the WHO-recommended
4-symptom TB screen, may be largely responsible for

unacceptably high rates of mortality due to undiagnosed
TB among PLHIV engaged in care in sub-Saharan Africa
[22, 23].

Per WHO guidelines, screening for the four TB symp-
toms (i.e, current cough, weight loss, night sweats, or
fever) should occur at every clinical care encounter for
PLHIV as the initial step in ICF to improve detection
and treatment of HIV-associated TB [20]. The recom-
mendation is based on a high sensitivity of the 4-
symptom screening rule (89.4 ) in detecting culture-
positive pulmonary TB disease among ART-naive
PLHIV [24]. However, low compliance in implementing
the 4-symptom TB screen at or prior to ART initiation
has been consistently observed in many high burden
TB-HIV countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including
South Africa (59 ) [23], Mozambique (61 ) [25], Kenya
(4 ) [26], and Cote dIvoire (36 ) [22]. Similarly, in
XPRES, failure to implement TB screening before ART
was the most “leaky” part of the ICF cascade in the SOC
phase, with only 30 screened before ART. Improving
the coverage of TB symptom screening from 30 in the
SOC to 100 in the EC and EC+X phases was the main
driver behind improved TB case detection from 1 in
SOC to 5-6 in EC and EC+X phases and therefore ap-
pears to have been a key driver behind the declines in
early ART mortality between SOC and subsequent EC
and EC+X phases.

Reasons for low compliance with TB screening proto-
cols in the SOC phase are not well understood, but
— — PAGE 11 — —

could have related to high patient load making health-
care workers more likely to omit key steps in care algo-
rithms, inadequate training and knowledge of the
guidelines, or deficiencies in monitoring and evaluation
[27]. In the SOC phase, having more advanced disease at
ART initiation (ie., having a lower weight and CD4
count) was associated with higher odds of being
screened for TB, suggesting that healthcare workers
were triaging the clients to receive TB screening based
on perception of disease stage. This finding might fit
with a clinic experiencing high patient volume and
HCW s rushing through patient consultations in order
to complete their clinical duties within available business
hours. Our intervention of providing additional nurses
to implement the TB screening, additional training, and
additional supervision increased the percentage of ART
enrollees screened for TB from 30 to 100 .

Notably, although the percentage of enrollees screen-
ing positive for 1 TB symptom who provided 1 spu-
tum sample increased from 38 in the SOC phase to
46 and 55 in the EC and EC+X phases, respectively,
collection of sputum samples remained a challenge even
in the EC phases. This low compliance with sputum col-
lection guidelines has been observed in multiple settings
[23, 27], with potential reasons being patient hesitance
to provide a sputum sample for stigma-related reasons,
true inability to provide a sputum sample, and HCW-
related reasons such as feeling overloaded, or lack of
confidence in the laboratory sample transport and diag-
nostic system [23]. Further research and interventions to
improve this component of the cascade are needed. In
addition, this finding supports calls for improved
sputum-independent diagnostic tests for TB.

A key reason that prior Xpert impact trials have gener-
ally not observed independent Xpert impact on mortality
is that higher rates of empiric TB treatment among cli-
ents with TB symptoms but a negative sputum-smear
microscopy result replaced any potential benefit of
Xperts improved diagnostic sensitivity in detecting
culture-positive TB [28, 29]. Similarly in our study, al-
though Xpert implementation was the driver behind in-
creased microbiological confirmation of TB diagnoses in
the EC+X versus EC phase (65 vs. 51 ), there was no
significant difference in percentage of ART enrollees
newly treated for TB (6 vs. 5 ). However, as reported
previously, Xpert was the driver behind reduced median
time from sputum collection to TB treatment in the
EC+X phase (6 days) versus the EC phase (22 days) [30].
Although no independent effect of Xpert on 6-month
mortality was observed in our study, two features of the
study suggest, similar to findings of a recent meta-
analysis of Xpert impact trials [31], that we cannot confi-
dently rule out the possibility of modest independent
Xpert impact: (1) our study was not powered to detect a

Page 11 of 14

difference between EC and EC+X 6-month mortality
and (2) the sensitivity analyses comparing EC vs. EC+X
6-month mortality rates generated AHRs of 0.90 (p=
0.793) and 0.79 (p=0.472), which could possibly point
to a modest Xpert impact our study was under-powered
to detect.

In ART programs in resource-limited settings, ob-
served LTFU from early ART is common, with an aver-
age of 20 LTFU by 12 months of follow-up [32, 33].
Mortality rates among LTFU ART patients are high [33].
The percentage of LTFU clients found to have died by
the time of tracing ranges from 20 to 60 [13, 33]. In
our study, 41 of patients LTFU in the first 6 months of
ART in the SOC phase had died by 6 months of follow-
up. Accumulating data show that among LTFU patients
who have died by the time of tracing, mortality rates are
highest shortly after the last clinic visit, the majority (>
90 ) die from illness rather than other causes (e.g.,
trauma), and the majority had some opportunity for
clinical intervention at the last visit [33]. In addition, six
previous trials, which aimed to evaluate Xpert impact on
patient-important outcomes, have reported that LTFU
of patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB, either
before or during TB treatment, almost certainly reduces
the potential impact of improved TB case finding on
mortality [8].

The reductions in LTFU achieved in EC and EC+X
phases compared with the SOC phase are likely due to a
combination of factors, including the strengthened tra-
cing intervention, additional training and nurses, and
possibly reduced incidence of missed visits due to inter-
current illness from undiagnosed TB [34]. The intensi-
fied tracing intervention might be particularly helpful in
maintaining a personalized partnership with clients
struggling with adherence to clinic visit schedules for a
variety of reasons to ensure minimal interruption in
ART pill taking [34]. These data support the underlying
principle that supportive services to retain patients in
HIV care are an essential component of both the ICF
and HIV treatment cascade.

The absence of an interaction between CD4 count at
ART initiation and intervention package effect size sug-
gests that ICF and retention interventions could be im-
portant for all new HIV clinic enrollees, not just those
with advanced disease as defined by WHO (CD4 count
< 200 copies/ml) [35]. Therefore, although median CD4
count at ART initiation is increasing in many countries,
including Botswana [36], with most countries having
adopted WHO universal HIV treatment guidelines, these
data support current WHO recommendations that high-
quality implementation of ICF and retention interven-
tions remains important for HIV clinic enrollees.

This study has a number of strengths and limitations.
Strengths include the large sample size, accurate

ascertainment of the primary mortality outcome, and
implementation in a real-world programmatic setting,
which improves generalizability of findings. Limitations
include the fact that the primary objective relies on an
adjusted pre-post analysis that is subject to residual con-
founding, and that data from the SOC phase were col-
lected retrospectively. In the SOC phase, TB screening
or sputum sample collection may sometimes have been
implemented but not documented. While retrospective
data collection in the SOC phase increases the likelihood
of missing covariate data, it also ensures that the type of
care received by clients in the SOC phase truly repre-
sents the care provided prior to implementation of the
EC and EC+X interventions. While EC and EC+X phases
were of different duration, our study results show good
compliance with ICF algorithm implementation and im-
pressive active tracing impact on LTFU throughout EC
and EC+X phases, indicating no discernable lag time
needed for these interventions to reach maximum po-
tential. In addition, good implementation of Xpert in the
EC+X phase is evidenced by the increase in the percent-
age of TB cases that were microbiologically confirmed in
EC+X versus EC phases, and in the shorter time from
sputum collection to TB treatment in EC+X versus EC
phases, with these results consistent with several prior
Xpert impact trials [8]. Notably, while these data support
effectiveness of the ICF and retention intervention in re-
ducing early ART mortality, future economic evaluation
would be needed to explore cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

In summary, a health system strengthening intervention
to improve compliance with WHO-recommended TB
symptom screening and ICF algorithms, combined with
active tracing to support retention of HIV and HIV-TB
co-infected patients in care through the early period of
ART, was associated with significant reductions in early
ART mortality and should be considered for scale-up. In
addition, similar to most other trials of Xpert impact on
mortality, replacing sputum-smear microscopy with
Xpert was not associated with a mortality reduction.

the Office of the Associate Director of Science at CDC Atlanta. Per guidance
from oversight bodies, XPRES was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov following
the change in the US Health and Human Services (HHS) and National
Institutes of Health (NIH) accepted definition of a clinical trial on January 25,
2015 [37]. At the time of study initiation on August 1, 2012, investigators and
oversight bodies did not consider XPRES met the pre-2015 HHS and NIH def-
inition of a clinical trial that was testing the “safety and effectiveness” of an
intervention, because the XPRES interventions were already considered safe
