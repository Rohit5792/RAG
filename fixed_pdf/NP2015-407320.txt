Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere (UH-LF-rTMS) in patients with stroke
can decrease interhemispheric inhibition from the unaffected to the affected hemisphere and improve hand dexterity and strength
of the paretic hand. The objective of this proof-of-principle study was to explore, for the first time, effects of UH-LF-rTMS as add-on
therapy to motor rehabilitation on short-term intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) of the motor cortex
of the unaffected hemisphere (M1,,;) in patients with ischemic stroke. Eighteen patients were randomized to receive, immediately
before rehabilitation treatment, either active or sham UH-LF-rTMS, during two weeks. Resting motor threshold (rMT), SICI, and
ICF were measured in M1, before the first session and after the last session of treatment. There was a significant increase in ICF in
the active group compared to the sham group after treatment, and there was no significant differences in changes in rMT or SICI.
ICF is a measure of intracortical synaptic excitability, with a relative contribution of spinal mechanisms. ICF is typically upregulated
by glutamatergic agonists and downregulated by gabaergic antagonists. The observed increase in ICF in the active group, in this
hypothesis- generating study, may be related to M1), reorganization induced by UH-LF-rTMS.

1. Introduction

Maladaptive plasticity in the form of excessive inhibition
of the affected hemisphere by the unaffected hemisphere
can negatively impact recovery of the paretic hand after
stroke. A single session of low-frequency repetitive tran-
scranial magnetic stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere

(UH-LF-rTMS) can downregulate excitability of the motor
cortex of the unaffected hemisphere (M1yj;), reflected by
decrease in amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs)
recorded from the nonparetic hand in patients in the chronic
phase after stroke [1]. Decrease in MEP amplitude may
be related to long-term-depression-like (LTD-like) plasticity
[2]. In addition, UH-LF-rTMS decreases the duration and
— — PAGE 2 — —
amplitude of the ipsilateral silent period, a measure of
interhemispheric inhibition recorded by delivering transcra-
nial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to M1 yy during voluntary
muscle contraction of the paretic hand [1].

Importantly, improvements in motor function of the
paretic hand were reported after single [1, 3, 4] or several
[5-11] sessions of UH-LF-rTMS, applied either alone or
in combination with motor training, in the subacute or
chronic stages after stroke. These encouraging results suggest
that UH-LF-rTMS has potential as an adjuvant therapeutic
strategy in stroke rehabilitation.

Despite these exciting findings, mechanisms underly-
ing effects of UH-LF-rTMS are not entirely clear. There
is virtually no information about effects of UH-LF-rTMS
on Mlyy, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) or
facilitation (ICF), in the subacute stage after stroke. SICI
and ICF probably reflect intracortical excitability in separate
excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with a relative contribu-
tion of spinal mechanisms to ICE. SICI is likely mediated
by GABAa receptors activity, while ICF is mainly influenced
by the glutamatergic system (NMDA receptors) [12-14]. The
objective of this pilot, double blinded, randomized proof-
of-principle study was to explore, for the first time, effects
of UH-LF-rTMS as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care
rehabilitation, on SICI and ICF of M1,)4;, in patients within 5-
45 days after ischemic stroke and mild to severe hand paresis.

2. Methods

The protocol was conducted as part of a study that compared
effects of UH-LF-rTMS or sham rTMS as add-on therapies to
standard-of-care rehabilitation [11].

2.1. Participants. Between February 2008 and October 2012,
1083 patients with ischemic stroke were screened for the
study. The flow chart is shown in Figure 1. Inclusion criteria
were age, 18-80 years; first-ever symptomatic ischemic stroke
involving up to 50X of the internal carotid artery territory,
confirmed by CT or MRI; time from stroke, 5-45 days; and
mild to severe hand paresis (Medical Research Council scale,
4-0 in finger flexion or extension).

Exclusion criteria were previous symptomatic strokes;
history of seizures; other neurologic diseases and uncon-
trolled chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure or
cancer; shoulder pain; joint deformity of the paretic upper
limb; and relative or absolute contraindications to TMS
[15]: use of implantable infusion pumps, pacemaker, preg-
nancy, intracranial hypertension, intracranial metal, bone
skull defects, and use of drugs that can interfere on cortical
excitability such as tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics,
or benzodiazepines. In addition, an implanted stent in the
carotid or vertebral arteries less than two months was con-
sidered a relative contraindication to TMS. Other exclusion
criteria were inability to provide informed consent due to
severe aphasia, anosognosia, or cognitive impairment as well
as inability to attend to treatment sessions. The protocol was
approved by the local Ethics Committee, and all patients

provided informed consent to participate. The protocol was
registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01333579).

One patient in the sham group had a recurrent stroke on
the day before the second session of treatment and did not
complete the study. Due to technical problems (malfunction
of the paired-pulse TMS stimulator), cortical excitability data
in 7 patients in the active group and 7 patients in the sham
group were not collected. One patient in the active group
coughed repeatedly during one of the TMS experiments.
Because contraction of facial muscles can interfere on cortical
excitability [16], data from this patient were excluded. There-
fore, data from 18 patients (9 per group) were analyzed.

2.2. Baseline Measures. The following characteristics were
evaluated at baseline: age, gender, handedness before
stroke (Oldfield inventory) [17], days after stroke, infarct
side/location, NIH stroke scale [18], and modified Rankin
scale. Infarcts were classified as corticosubcortical or
subcortical according to involvement of primary motor,
primary somatosensory, supplementary motor, or premotor
cortices on MRI (16) or CT (2) by a radiologist blinded to
group assignment.

2.3. Experimental Design. Patients were randomized in
blocks by the principal investigator with a basic random
number computerized generator in a 1:1 ratio to receive
immediately before rehabilitation treatment lasting for 60
minutes, either active or sham rTMS, five days per week,
during two weeks (total, 10 treatment sessions). Patients were
unaware of group assignment.

2.4. rTMS Intervention. In each treatment session, the opti-
mal site of motor stimulation of the UH (“hot spot”) was
defined as the location where TMS elicited the largest MEPs
in the nonparetic abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB)
with surface electrodes. The signal was amplified and fil-
tered (10 Hz to 2kHz) with an electromyography (EMG)
and evoked potential measuring unit (MEB-9104 J, Nihon
Kohden, Japan).

In both groups, 1Hz rI!'MS was administered with a
figure-of-eight coil (MCF B-65) at 90X of the nonparetic
APB muscle resting motor threshold (rMT) with a biphasic
MagPro compact stimulator (Alpine Biomed), for 25 minutes
(1500 pulses). For the active intervention, TMS coil was
tangentially positioned by an investigator on the nonparetic
APB “hot spot” in the UH with the intersection of both wings
at 45° angle with the midline. In the sham intervention, the
coil was held perpendicularly to the vertex. All patients were
comfortably seated, with their arms in a constant relaxed
position, wore earplugs, and were instructed to remain at rest
during TMS.

2.5. Outcome Measures. TMS was delivered to the UH at
the nonparetic APB “hot spot” through a figure-of-eight
shaped coil (mean diameter 70mm), connected to a Bi-
Stim 200? module (MagStim, UK). The coil was held by
an investigator. EMG activity was recorded from surface
electrodes placed over the unaffected APB. EMG responses

were amplified (x1000), filtered (2Hz-2kHz), sampled at
5kHz and recorded on a computerized data acquisition
system built with the LabVIEW graphical programming
language [19]. Its conditional triggering feature was used to
deliver TMS stimuli only when the APB muscle was relaxed.
Relaxation of APB muscle was defined as EMG activity
at baseline <50uV peak-to-peak amplitude for at least 1
second [19]. Trials showing EMG activity >50 uV peak-to-
peak amplitude were excluded during recordings. Vigilance
was continuously monitored by an investigator sitting in
front of the patient. This investigator was also in charge of
running the LabVIEW acquisition system and saving data
files throughout the experiment.

The following TMS measurements were performed before
the first (DO) session of treatment and after the last (D10)
session of treatment in patients in both groups:

(i) rMT, defined as the minimum TMS intensity required
to elicit at least three out of six MEPs > 50 microV in
consecutive trials [20, 21];

(ii) SICI and ICF measured with paired-pulse TMS [22,
23]. The conditioning stimulus (CS) intensity was set
to 80X of the unaffected APB rMT. The intensity
of the test stimulus (TS) was that required to evoke
MEPs of approximately 0.5 to 1 mV. The order of pre-
sentation of inhibitory (2 ms), excitatory (10 ms), and

control (test stimulus alone) trials was randomized.
Eighteen trials were recorded for each interstimulus
interval. Results are expressed as average percentages
of MEP amplitudes in conditioning trials and in test
trials.

Raw data from paired-pulse experiments were inspected
by an investigator blinded to group assignment with a
playback application in system built with the LabiVIEW
graphical programming language (sampling rate 5000 Khz)
[19].

2.6. Statistical Analysis. This was an exploratory study and
determination of the sample size was not formally deter-
mined to evaluate TMS outcomes. Data are presented as
means (+standard deviations) or as medians and inter-
vals. Distribution was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk test.
Normally distributed data were analyzed with parametric
tests. Nonnormally distributed data were analyzed with
nonparametric tests. Baseline characteristics were compared
with Mann-Whitney or Fisher's exact tests. Between-group
differences in changes in rMT, SICI, and ICF (baseline — after
treatment, DO — D10) were compared with Mann-Whitney
tests. P values < 0,05 were considered statistically significant.

3. Results

There were no significant differences in baseline character-
istics between the active and sham groups (Table 1). There
were no serious adverse events. In the active group, two
patients reported headache or local pain (22.2X ), two patients
reported nuchal pain (22.2M), and five patients reported
drowsiness (55.6%). In the sham group, three patients
reported headache or local pain (33.3), four patients
reported nuchal pain (44.4), and six patients reported
drowsiness (66.7X ).

Results are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. There was a
significant increase in ICF in the active group compared to
the sham group after treatment (P = 0,038). Five patients
in the active group and only one patient in sham group
presented increase in ICF after treatment. ICF decreased in
five subjects in the sham group.

There were no significant differences in changes in rMT
(P = 0489) or SICI (P = 0,145) after treatment between the
two groups. Post hoc analysis showed that the power to find
significant differences between the two groups was 20X for
rMT and 34X for SICI.

One of the subjects (Patient 4 of the sham group in
Figure 2) presented a higher level of ICF (571.8% ) compared
to other subjects, at baseline. We did not find an objective
reason to exclude this subject from the analysis. However,
post hoc analysis was performed without this subject, and the
difference in change in ICF between the two groups was no
longer statistically significant (P = 0,074).

4. Discussion

The main result of this study was the increase in ICF in
Mlyy after 10 sessions of UH-LF-rTMS in patients with
hand paresis, in the subacute phase after ischemic stroke.
ICF increased in the active group and decreased in the sham
group. Both groups received customary rehabilitation during
the protocol.

This is the first time that a change in ICF in the UH is
reported after UH-LF-rTMS. ICF is a measure of intracortical
synaptic excitability, with a relative contribution of spinal
mechanisms. ICF is usually upregulated by glutamatergic

agonists [21]. Because ICF has a spinal component, a spinal
mechanism underlying the observed change cannot be
excluded.

The observed increase in ICF in M1 yy in the active group
is consistent with results obtained in patients at a chronic
stage (average, 31 months after stroke), after 10 sessions
of constraint-induced therapy (CIT) [24]. CIT consists of
restraint of the unaffected upper limb during waking hours
and intensive and repetitive task-oriented therapy of the
affected upper extremity, to overcome reliance on the non-
paretic upper limb to perform daily activities, and consequent
“learned nonuse” of the paretic limb.

It is possible that changes in the M1; synaptic excitabil-
ity may reflect reorganization induced by specific interven-
tions such as rTMS or CIT. Reorganization in Mlyz, does
not necessarily translate into measurable, relevant motor
improvement of the paretic upper limb. For instance, modi-
fied CIT (shaping training of the paretic hand, with or without
restraint of the upper limb for two weeks) is associated
with increased cortical thickness in Mlyy [25]. However,
— — PAGE 6 — —
increased thickness does not correlate with enhancement of
motor function evaluated with the Wolf Motor Function Test
or the Motor Activity log. The link between structural or
functional changes in M1, and behavioral improvements
remains to be clarified.

A single session of LF-rTMS was reported to decrease
ICF in the stimulated hemisphere in healthy subjects, when
a similar paired-pulse protocol was applied by Romero et
al. [26]. The opposite result observed in patients with stroke
may reflect a difference in experimental paradigm (one
rTMS session in the study by Romero et al., in contrast
with ten sessions in the present study) or a state-dependent
phenomenon; that is, effects of rTMS may vary according to
baseline excitability of the stimulated cortex [27].

We did not include a control group to investigate dif-
ferences in baseline excitability between patients with stroke
and controls. The two studies that compared ICF in the UH
of patients in the subacute phase after stroke, and ICF in
hemispheres of healthy subjects, did not report significant
differences [4, 28]. Still, comparable ICF at baseline should
not necessarily translate into comparable responsiveness to
ten sessions of rTMS.

The lack of significant changes in rMT or SICI may reflect
absence of changes in membrane excitability mediated by
ion channels, as well as absence of modulation of gabaergic
synapses mediating SICI, by 1Hz rTMS of Mlyy. Alter-
natively, it may reflect insufficient power given the study's
sample size.

Still, the main limitation of this study is the number of
patients. After screening 1083 patients, 34 patients fulfilled
criteria to participate in the study. This low rate of inclusion
is consistent with those reported in other studies of TMS
in stroke [29]. Then, because of technical problems with
the stimulator, data from 14 patients were not available.
Post hoc analysis showed that if results from one patient
were excluded, the results would no longer be statistically
significant. Nevertheless, we did not find an objective reason
to exclude this subject. Furthermore, the number of subjects
included in the analysis was not substantially different from
those reported by other studies that evaluated excitability
to TMS in patients with stroke [4, 28]. Considering that
SICI and ICF vary considerably even in healthy subjects,
multicenter studies may be necessary to overcome challenges
in this field of research.

Another limitation of this study is the lack of evaluation of
interhemispheric inhibition after UH-LF-rTMS. In patients
with mild hand paresis in the chronic phase after stroke,
interhemispheric inhibition of the affected hemisphere by the
UH, evaluated by the ipsilateral silent period, decreases after
UH-LF-rTMS [1]. Recording of the ipsilateral silent period in
this context involves stimulation of the UH during voluntary
contraction of the paretic hand. We could not record the
ipsilateral silent period because we included patients with
severe hand motor deficits, unable to perform hand muscle
contractions in the paretic hand, as required to record the
ipsilateral silent period while applying TMS to the M1lyz.
Finally, spinal excitability was not evaluated.

In summary, the increase in ICF in Mlyjz, after ten
sessions of active UH-LF-rTMS indicates that modulation

Neural Plasticity

of synaptic excitability in the UH or in the spinal cord is
associated with this intervention. Further studies are required
to confirm this result in a larger sample of patients with stroke
and to investigate the functional role of this phenomenon,
possibly related to reorganization, in stroke recovery.
