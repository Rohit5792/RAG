Objective To evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and efficacy of iberdomide in patients
with SLE. lberdomide is. a high-affinity. cereblon. ligand that
targets the hematopoietic transcription factors Ikaros and
Aiolos for. proteasomal degradation.

Methods A 12-week, multicentre, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in active SLE
was followed by a 2-year, open-label active treatment
extension. phase (ATEP) (NCT02185040). In the. dose-
escalation phase, adults with active SLE were randomised
to. oral placebo. or iberdomide. (0.3.mg. every. other day,

0.3 mg once daily, 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg alternating once
daily, or 0.6mg_once daily). Primary endpoints. were safety
and tolerability.

Results. The dose-escalation phase enrolled 42 patients,
with 33 completing this phase and 17 patients enrolling
into. the ATEP. In the. dose-escalation phase, the. most
common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs;
iberdomide/placebo. groups) were nausea (20.6%/12.5%),.
diarrhoea (17.6%/12.5%) and upper respiratory tract
infection (11.8%/12.5%). Most TEAEs were mild or.
moderate in severity and more common in the highest
dose groups in. both. study. phases. In the dose-escalation
phase, Physician’s Global Assessment and Cutaneous
Lupus Erythematosus. Disease Area and Severity. Index
(CLASI) activity scores improved relative to baseline and
placebo. in all iberdomide groups, with a trend toward
continued score improvements in the ATEP. In the dose-
escalation. phase, iberdomide treatment resulted in dose-.
dependent reductions in total B cells and plasmacytoid
dendritic. cells in blood. Improvements in CLASI activity
scores correlated with plasmacytoid dendritic cell
depletion.

Conclusions These proof-of-concept findings suggest a
favourable benefit/risk ratio in SLE for iberdomide, a drug.
with a novel immunomodulatory mechanism of action,
supporting further. clinical. investigation.

Iberdomide (CC-220) is a high-affinity cereblon ligand
that promotes ubiquitination and subsequent degrada-
tion of Aiolos and Ikaros by the proteasome." In B cells
from healthy donors and patients with SLE, iberdomide
reduces Aiolos and Ikaros protein levels, thereby inhib-
iting BAFF-induced and CD40L-induced proliferation,
plasmablast differentiation and IgG secretion in vitro.”
In cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
patients with SLE, iberdomide inhibited anti-dsDNA and
anti-phospholipid IgM autoantibody production in vitro.°

The effects of iberdomide on cell populations in
healthy volunteers were examined in a single-ascending
dose study.° At oral doses of 0.3-6mg once daily (QD),
iberdomide decreased intracellular Aiolos levels in B
cells and T cells, decreased absolute CD19+ Bcell counts
in peripheral blood, increased interleukin (IL)-2 and
decreased IL-1B production ex vivo.° In a multiple-
ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, iberdomide
exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner,” with
a terminal half-life of 9-13 hours following a single dose.
Iberdomide decreased peripheral CD19+ B lymphocytes
(maximum effect (E,.), 92.4%; half maximal effective
concentration (EC,,), 0.718ng/mL) and more modestly
reduced CD3+ T lymphocytes (E,,., 34.8%; EC,,,
0.932 ng/mL). In ex vivo whole blood samples, levels of
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated proinflammatory cytokines
IL-1 and IL-1B8 were reduced, but anti-CD3-stimulated
IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-y levels were increased in
blood from iberdomide-treated versus placebo-treated
subjects. Thus, dose-dependent, differential immuno-
modulatory effects on B and T lymphocytes were noted
in healthy volunteers receiving iberdomide, consistent
with iberdomide-induced reductions in Ikaros and Aiolos
levels within T lymphocytes.

The observed effects of iberdomide on B and T lympho-
cytes as well as cytokine levels in these studies suggest that
it may represent a unique approach to the treatment of
SLE. Iberdomide safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), phar
macodynamics and efficacy were therefore explored in a
phase 2 proof-of-concept study of patients with SLE.

METHODS
Trial design
CC-220-SLE-001 (NCT02185040) was a multicentre phase
2 study consisting of two parts. The 12-week, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase randomised
patients 4:1 (via interactive voice response system) to
oral iberdomide at one of four dose levels (0.3 mg every
other day (QOD), 0.3mg QD, 0.6mg and 0.3mg QD
on alternating days, or 0.6mg QD), or placebo. Dose
interruptions of up to 14 days were allowed for patients
experiencing a clinically significant iberdomide-related
adverse event (AE); for patients unable to remain on
their assigned dose, iberdomide doses were reduced to
the next lower dose level.

Following the 12-week dose-escalation phase, eligible
patients could enrol directly into the 2-year, open-label,

active treatment extension phase (ATEP). Patients may
have had a period of no treatment between the study parts
as they waited for study amendment to enrol in the ATEP.
Those who discontinued the dose-escalation phase early
or did not consent to enter the ATEP were followed for
12 weeks. The iberdomide dose in the ATEP was assigned
based on the dose received in the dose-escalation phase
(online supplemental figure 1).

Patients

Eligible patients were 218 years of age with a diagnosis
for 26 months of SLE per American College of Rheu-
matology 1997 criteria’’ and a hybrid Safety of Estro-
gens in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus National Assess-
ment (SELENA)-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease
Activity Index (SLEDAI) score'* of >4 points at baseline.
This cut-off value was used to increase patient recruitment
for this phase 2 study focused on safety, PK and phar-
macodynamics. Patients could have qualified based on
serology scores alone; however, all patients who entered
the study had active disease and pertinent clinical scoring
(skin and/or joints and/or other organ involvement).
The hybrid SELENA-SLEDAT score is differentiated from
the SELENA-SLEDAI score based on the definition of
proteinuria, in which the hybrid SELENA-SLEDAT score
uses >0.5¢/24 hours and the previous definition of ‘new
onset or recent increase of >0.5¢/24 hours’ has been
removed. Oral corticosteroids (<10mg prednisone or
equivalent daily) and/or antimalarials (hydroxychloro-
quine, chloroquine, and/or quinacrine) were allowed
if doses had been stable for 4 weeks prior to randomi-
sation. No other systemic immunosuppressive treatments
were permitted during the dose-escalation phase. Meth-
otrexate, sulfasalazine or leflunomide were permitted
during the ATEP. Patients may have taken alternative
standard-of-care therapies between study phases. Key
exclusion criteria were unstable lupus nephritis (esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate <50mL/min/1.73 m’),
active central nervous system disease requiring thera-
peutic intervention within 6 months of screening and the
presence of infectious disease.

Endpoints. and. assessments

For the dose-escalation phase, the primary endpoint
was safety and tolerability. The secondary endpoint was
PK as measured by parameters including area under the
plasma concentration-time curve calculated from time
zero to infinity (AUC, ,), maximum observed plasma
concentration (C,), time to peak serum concentra-
tion (T),,,), terminal elimination half-life (t,,,), apparent
clearance from plasma and apparent volume of distribu-
tion during the terminal phase. Exploratory endpoints
included leucocyte subset determinations in peripheral
blood on days 1, 29, 57 and 85 as measured by flow cytom-
etry. Efficacy measures were also exploratory endpoints,
and included change from baseline in Cutaneous Lupus
Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI)

Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) scores, and swollen
and tender joint count. These were assessed on days 1,
15, 29 and 57, at final treatment visit (day 85), and during
follow-up visits at 4 and 12 weeks post-treatment. In the
ATEP, these efficacy measures were assessed at weeks 1, 4
and 12, every 3 months thereafter, and at final treatment
and observational follow-up. In the ATEP, the primary
endpoints were long-term safety and tolerability, and
secondary endpoints were long-term efficacy measures.

Blood samples for PK analysis were obtained during
the dose-escalation phase only. Sparse PK samples were
collected from all patients predose on days 15, 29, 57
and 85. A subset of patients (four per treatment group)
participated in intensive PK sampling collected on days |
and 29 predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6-8 and 24 hours post-
dose, in addition to sparse PK sampling times. Concentra-
tions of iberdomide were determined by validated liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay.’
Peripheral blood samples for pharmacodynamic analysis
were collected at baseline, days 29 and 57, and at the final
study visit.

Statistical analysis

The safety population was defined as all patients who
received 21 dose of iberdomide. The intent-to-treat popu-
lation was defined as all patients randomised according
to the protocol who received 21 dose of iberdomide. The
PK and pharmacodynamic populations were defined as
all patients in the safety population with 21 non-missing
plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic §assess-
ment, respectively. This was a proof-of-concept study,
and no formal sample size or power calculations were
performed. Both parts of the trial used descriptive statis-
tics (eg, mean, SD, and no p values were provided. AEs
were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regu-
latory Activities V.21.0 and were summarised by system
organ class, preferred term, severity and relationship
to iberdomide. PK parameters were determined from
patients in the intensive PK subset by non-compartmental
analysis method (Phoenix WinNonLin V.6.3). For
patients entering the ATEP, new baseline values for effi-
cacy measures were determined at ATEP entry; original
baseline values from dose-escalation phase were not
used for ATEP efficacy analyses. Statistical analyses were
performed using SAS V.9.2 or higher.

RESULTS

Patient disposition. and. baseline. characteristics

The study was initiated in December 2014 and 42 patients
were enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled,
dose-escalation phase of the study; 93% were female,
the mean age was 47 years, 64% were white (table 1).
The most common concomitant medications were
hydroxychloroquine (62%) and prednisone (48%; at
doses <10mg of prednisone equivalent). At baseline,
all patients had skin and/or joint involvement as deter
mined by CLASI and joint counts, respectively. Baseline

mean (SD) CLASI scores varied considerably between
treatment groups, from a low of 4.3 (5.9) in the placebo
group to a high of 17.6 (12.9) in the iberdomide 0.3mg
QOD group. At baseline, 78.6% (33 of 42) and 66.7% (28
of 42) of patients had at least one tender joint or one
swollen joint, respectively. Baseline mean (SD) hybrid
SELENA-SLEDAI scores ranged from 5.5 (2.1) in the
0.3mg QD group to 8.4 (4.1) in the 0.3mg QOD group,
with hybrid SELENA-SLEDAT scores in between for the
other dose groups. All patients had a baseline hybrid
SELENA-SLEDAI score of 24 except one patient who had
baseline hybrid SELENA-SLEDAI score of 2 after having
a qualifying hybrid SELENA-SLEDAI score at screening.
In the iberdomide groups, eight patients (23.5%) discon-
tinued prior to dose-escalation study completion, most
commonly due to AEs (n=5 patients) (online supple-
mental figure 2; table 1).

Seventeen of the 33 eligible patients (52%) enrolled in
the ATEP. The median time between completion of dose
escalation and the start of ATEP was 311 days (range,
3-527) and the last study visit occurred in September
2018. Nine patients received iberdomide 0.3mg QD;
eight received iberdomide 0.6/0.3 mg on alternating days.
Demographics and characteristics of patients entering the
ATEP were similar to those in the dose-escalation phase.
Ten (59%) patients in the ATEP discontinued treatment,
including five (29%) who discontinued due to treatment-
emergent AEs (TEAEs), of whom four (24%) were in the
iberdomide 0.6/0.3 mg on alternating days and one (6%)
was in the iberdomide 0.3mg QD group.

Safety

Mean (SD) treatment duration in the double-blind,
placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase ranged from
9.5 (4.4) to 11.8 (0.5) weeks (online supplemental table
1). TEAEs were reported in five (62.5%) patients in the
placebo group and 30 (88.2%) patients in the iberdomide
groups (table 2). Among iberdomide-treated patients in
the dose-escalation phase, the most common TEAEs were
nausea (20.6%), diarrhoea (17.6%) and upper respira-
tory tract infection (11.8%) (table 2). All four patients
with vitamin D deficiency had low vitamin D levels prior
to receiving iberdomide. Neutropenia and pneumonia
(8.8% each) were reported in the two highest iberdomide
dose groups.

In the longer duration ATEP (mean (SD) duration 75.6
(32.9) weeks (iberdomide 0.3mg QD) and 49.5 (37.4)
weeks (iberdomide 0.6/0.3mg on alternating days)),
TEAEs were also primarily gastrointestinal or infectious
in origin. The most common were upper respiratory
tract infection (41.2%), bronchitis (35.3%), diarrhoea
(23.5%) and urinary tract infection (23.5%). In both the
dose-escalation phase and the ATEP, most TEAEs were of
mild or moderate severity.

During the dose-escalation phase, one patient each
receiving iberdomide 0.6/0.3 mg on alternating days and
iberdomide 0.6mg QD group had severe pneumonia, and
one patient in the latter group had severe neutropenia.

During the ATEP, five severe TEAEs (gastroenteritis,

0.3mg QD group had a severe TEAE.

During the dose-escalation phase, serious TEAEs were
reported in two iberdomide-treated patients (5.9%; both
pneumonia in the two highest iberdomide dose groups,
one of which was considered treatment related) and in

two (25.0%) patients in the placebo group (deep vein
thrombosis, schizoaffective disorder and SLE). In the
ATEP, serious TEAEs occurred in four patients (23.5%;
pulmonary embolism, seizure, SLE and vitreous detach-
ment); all were observed with the higher iberdomide
dose (0.6/0.3mg on alternating days), and none were
considered treatment related.

neutrophil counts at baseline were more likely to expe-
rience a higher grade of neutropenia. The neutropenia
was reversible, and patients recovered to prior neutrophil
counts after temporary interruption of iberdomide. No
other clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values,
vital signs, weight or ECG findings were observed during
the dose-escalation phase or the ATEP.

Eight iberdomide-treated patients (23.5%) — discon-
tinued prior to completion of the dose-escalation phase,
most commonly due to AEs (five patients (14.7%)). These
consisted of pneumonia (n=2), neutropenia, dermatitis, diar-
rhoea, ecchymosis and maculopapular rash (n=1 each); none

were in the iberdomide 0.3mg dose groups. In the ATEP, the
higher iberdomide dose group (0.6/0.3mg on alternating
days) had a higher incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment
interruption or withdrawal (four of eight (50%); bronchitis,
gastroenteritis, decreased neutrophil count, oral candidiasis
and pulmonary embolism, one each) than the iberdomide
0.3mg QD group (one of nine (11.1%); small fibre neurop-
athy). No opportunistic infections were reported and no
clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or ECG findings
were observed. Two cases of thromboembolic events were
observed in the study: one pulmonary embolism in the iber-
domide 0.3/0.6 alternating days group in the ATEP and

AEs in the study.

Efficacy

Efficacy was an exploratory objective in this study, which was
not powered for statistical significance; however, evidence of
clinical activity with iberdomide was observed for multiple
endpoints. In the placebo-controlled dose-escalation phase,
mean hybrid SELENA-SLEDAI scores showed a trend toward
improvement in all groups, including placebo (figure 1A).
At day 85, 22%-50% of patients in the iberdomide groups
achieved a 24point reduction from baseline in hybrid
SELENA-SLEDAI scores!” compared with 13% in the
placebo group. Improvements were greatest in the iberdo-
mide 0.6/0.3mg alternating days group, with a mean (SD)

reduction of 2.9 (3.4) points on day 85. The trend toward
hybrid SELENA-SLEDAI score improvement continued
during the ATEP in both iberdomide groups, with improve-
ment in the 0.3mg QD group consistently greater than in
the 0.6/0.3mg alternating days group after week 4 (online
supplemental figure 3). At week 96, two of five patients in
the 0.3mg QD group and none in the 0.6/0.3 mg alternating
days group had achieved a 24point reduction in hybrid
SELENA-SLEDAI score from ATEP baseline.

In the dose-escalation phase, a trend toward improve-
ment from baseline in CLASI score through week 12 was
observed in the iberdomide groups, with minimal changes
observed in the placebo group (figure 1B). At day 85, the
mean (SD; percentage change from baseline) change from
baseline in CLASI scores was +0.4 (1.8; +9.5%) in the placebo
group and —7.8 (10.2; -35.3%), -5.0 (9.6; -63.4%), -4.3 (6.3;

-25.3%), and -6.0 (9.7; -39.8%) in the iberdomide 0.3mg
QOD, 0.3mg QD, 0.6/0.3mg alternating days, and 0.6mg
QD groups, respectively. The minimal clinically important
difference in CLASI score of —4 (16) was exceeded in all iber
domide groups but not in the placebo group at day 85, and
a trend toward improved CLASI score over time in the iber-
domide groups was also evident among patients with base-
line CLASI score 210 (figure 1F). Improvements in CLASI
score relative to baseline also were observed in the ATEP by
the first post-baseline time point (week 1), and mean values
remained below ATEP baseline values throughout the treat-
ment period (online supplemental figure 4).

In the dose-escalation phase, PGA scores improved in
all iberdomide treatment groups (but not the placebo
group), exceeding the minimal clinically important differ
ence of -0.3' '* at days 57 and 85 (figure 1C). The greatest
improvements in PGA scores at day 85 were noted in the
iberdomide 0.3mg QD and 0.6mg QD groups. Improve-
ments in PGA scores from ATEP baseline through week 96
were also noted in the ATEP (online supplemental figure
5). At ATEP week 96, mean (SD; percentage change from
baseline) PGA scores were —0.52 (0.6; -47.8%) and -0.20
(no SD (n=1); -14.3%) relative to ATEP baseline in the
iberdomide 0.3mg QD and 0.6/0.3mg alternating days
groups, respectively.

In the dose-escalation phase, tender joint counts and
swollen joint counts appeared to decrease in all iberdo-
mide dose groups at day 85 (figure 1D and E). This trend
continued during the ATEP in the iberdomide 0.3mg
group only.

PK and pharmacodynamics
PK samples were available for 33 patients; all were
included in the PK analysis. Iberdomide plasma PK was
characterised by rapid absorption, with C, occurring
at a median T, of 2-6hours for all dose levels (online
supplemental table 2). The geometric mean t,,, ranged
from approximately 8-12hours. Plasma concentrations
showed dose-related increases between dosing groups
(online supplemental figure 6), with accumulation ratios
of approximately 1.6 (AUC and C_) upon multiple
dosing in non-alternating cohorts at steady state. A PK/
pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated decreasing
CD19 B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)
with increasing exposure to iberdomide (online supple-
mental figure 7A,B). There was no relationship between
iberdomide plasma levels and CD3 T cells or neutrophils
at the doses studied, but an increase in peripheral blood
plasma cells with increasing iberdomide C,, ,, levels was
observed (online supplemental figure 7C-E).
Iberdomide treatment resulted in dose-dependent
reductions in total CD20 B cells, immature B cells,
switched memory B cells and CD268 (BAFFR) B cells
as well as pDCs (figure 2). There were no significant
changes in CD4+ T cells in any groups; at the highest
iberdomide dose group, 0.6mg QD, there was a trend
for an increase in CD8+ T cells (figure 2). Anti-dsDNA
antibody levels were within the normal range at baseline

for many patients (with median values of 12TU/mL in
each treatment group). The least-squares mean increase
in anti-dsDNA was 99.61U/mL in the placebo group at
week 12, and the iberdomide groups had moderate mean
increases or decreases (<25TU/mL) over 12 weeks. There
was a strong correlation between CLASI improvement
and pDC depletion in all patients (figure 3A), as well as
in patients with baseline CLASI score 210 (figure 3B).
In contrast, depletion of B cells did not correlate with
improvements in CLASI score in either of these groups
(figure 3C,D).

DISCUSSION

Iberdomide, an orally available agent which binds to
the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, results in the
proteasomal degradation of key immune cell transcrip-
tional regulators Ikaros and Aiolos. Preclinical and ex
vivo evidence suggests that iberdomide could represent
a unique approach to the treatment of SLE. The present
two-part proof-of-concept study was designed primarily
to determine the safety and tolerability of iberdomide in
patients with SLE.

In both the dose-escalation phase and the ATEP, the
most commonly reported TEAEs in patients receiving
iberdomide were gastrointestinal events and infections;
most were mild or moderate in severity. TEAE frequency
and severity appeared to be dose dependent. Serious or
severe TEAEs were observed only in the highest iberdo-
mide dose groups (0.6/0.3 mg alternating days and 0.6 mg
QD); most discontinuations due to TEAFs occurred in
the two highest iberdomide dose groups.

Neutropenia was an expected AE. In vitro studies indi-
cated an inhibitory effect of iberdomide on neutrophil
maturation, but with full recovery of normal maturation
following a 5-day drug-free period (data on file). In the
present study, neutropenia AEs were relatively infrequent
(11.1% and 12.5% in the iberdomide 0.3mg QD and
0.6/0.3 mg alternating days groups, respectively) over the
prolonged course of treatment (median 95.9 and 60.6
weeks, respectively) in the ATEP. Cases of neutropenia
were addressed with temporary dose interruptions with
recovery to the prior count level in most instances. The
long duration of iberdomide treatment suggests that
iberdomide is well tolerated and TEAEs can be effectively
managed.

Iberdomide was rapidly absorbed, with dose-related
increases in systemic exposure over the dose range. Effi-
cacy, as previously noted, was an exploratory endpoint in
this study, which was not powered for hypothesis testing
and for which statistical significance was not assessed.
Mean PGA scores improved relative to baseline in all
iberdomide groups (but not the placebo group) during
dose escalation and continued to improve over the course
of the ATEP, which was not placebo controlled. Hybrid
SELENA-SLEDAI scores trended toward improved values
in all groups, including placebo in the dose-escalation
phase of the study, but with a greater percentage of

baseline among iberdomide groups. Results for tender
and swollen joint counts in both study parts were mixed
during dose escalation, with most iberdomide groups
tending toward reduced mean values over time. These
efficacy measures in the ATEP showed similar trends
through 96 weeks (final ATEP visit).

During the dose-escalation phase, a trend toward
numerically improved CLASI scores through week 12 was
observed for all iberdomide treatment groups (but not
the placebo group) relative to baseline values. Notably,
although the lowest dose iberdomide group (0.3mg
QOD) appeared to have the greatest reductions in CLASI
scores, patients in this cohort also had the highest mean

CLASI score of any group at baseline (17.6). Baseline
values in the other treatment groups ranged from 4.3 to
12.4. These baseline differences and the small sample
size limit conclusions regarding dose effects of iberdo-
mide. When analysing the pharmacodynamic immune
cell data, improvements in CLASI score were correlated
with observed depletion in pDCs (the principal source of
IFN- '°) but not B cells, among all iberdomide-treated
patients as well as in those with baseline CLASI score
210. These findings suggest that in patients with SLE
treated with iberdomide, the trend toward improvement
in the cutaneous manifestations of SLE was related to
pDC depletion but not B cell number and/or activity.
Although the IFN signature was not examined in the
current study, these observations are consistent with
iberdomide-mediated reduction in type I IFN response as
its operative mechanism of action.

The PK/pharmacodynamic analysis revealed a rela-
tionship between iberdomide drug exposure levels and
decreases in pDCs and B cells, as well as an unexpected
increase in peripheral blood plasma cells. The increased
plasma cell numbers in the blood, observed mainly in the
0.6mg QD dose group, might be driven by an increased
production of IL-2 and IL-10, which can act as plasma
cell differentiation factors.”” This observed increase in
plasma cells, combined with the upward trend in CD8+
T cells, suggests that the 0.6 mg QD iberdomide dose may
result in undesirable pharmacodynamic effects in the

context of lupus treatment. No dose-dependent effects
of iberdomide were observed on anti-dsDNA antibody
levels at 12 weeks; however, a subsequent study showed a
dose-dependent decrease in these antibody levels starting
after 16 weeks of treatment in patients with baseline levels
>81U/mL.”!

Study limitations include the small sample size, the size-
able time gap between the dose-escalation phase and the
ATEP, and the limited (12weeks) duration of the dose-
escalation phase, a particularly short period given that
4 weeks may be required for the full pharmacodynamic
effects of iberdomide to manifest. A patient population
with mild disease activity enrolled in this study based on
the relatively low mean baseline hybrid SELENA-SLEDAT
scores (4.9-8.4) and the exclusion of patients receiving
>10mg/day of prednisone or any background immuno-
suppressants. Lower CLASI and PGA scores in the placebo
group at baseline limit the ability to identify treatment
differences for these outcomes.

Our findings suggest a tolerable short-term (dose
escalation) and long-term (ATEP) safety profile for
iberdomide in patients with SLE, consistent with that
reported in the first-in-human study.'* Multiple vali-
dated measures, particularly PGA and CLASI scores,
provided directional evidence of iberdomide efficacy.
Taken as a whole, findings from this proof-of-concept
study support further investigation of iberdomide in
patients with SLE.
